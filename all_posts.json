my Fitbit Sense 2 broke and it seemed like a dumb idea to replace it when the company is dead Ive had the Pixel Watch for about a week now and I think it could be so much better if it didnt have all these features that I would just pull out my phone to do anyway The biggest problem I have with this watch is that the damn thing cannot even last 24 hours on a charge half the time When do you guys charge this watch I used to just charge my old smart watches when I showered pretty much everyday and that was enough for them to stay on 247 on my wrist But thats not enough with this watch A 30 min shower  charge doesnt get me anywhere near 100 and the watch dies when its supposed to track my sleep I believe that a consistent 2 days battery life and quick charging capability are essential for a smartwatch because theyre expected to be on all the time for accurate health tracking Why are these not on Googles third iteration of a smartwatch or on most Wear OS smart watches out there Im seriously confused There are only 4 things I want in a watch lmk if yall value other features on Pixel Watch btw Im always looking for new useful features to learn health tracking and emergency features informative widgets  notifications with options to reply back with voice or quick replies apps that try to aid something Im doing irl and keeps me from having to pull my phone out like showing the next direction when Im navigating on Google Maps Its so disappointing to me how much bloat is on here Literally any app on this thing that is not related to health tracking tracking Like Todoist WhatsApp Gmail  are just clones of the phone app equivalent on a watch where you can scroll around around and type things Who uses these Wouldnt you just pull out your phone to do these things Ever since Fitbit got acquired Ive been struggling to understand why these major smartwatches on the market with Wear OS are so bloated with things Id rather do on a phone  that their battery lives are worse than smart watches from 510 years ago Let me know what yall think Am I missing something here ","17":"I was a long time Android user that switched to iOS so that I could iMessage my kids Theyre now grown enough to have phones so I can finally ditch Apple Land if I want to While I do MASSIVELY prefer android phones to iPhones love my Oneplus 8T and have been using it for the last couple of weeks again the relatively seamless integration of iOS stuff is pretty nice I bought and returned a Galaxy Watch 6 this weekend Compared to my Apple WatchiPhone 13 pairing the GW6 just didnt seem to work as tightly with my Oneplus phone as the AW does with the iP My question is does using a Pixel Phone with the Pixel Watch work as nicely as the Apple stuff With the GW6 I had issues like I would still get phone calls ringing on the phone instead of the watch despite having activated the setting to only get notifications on the watch It was a series of annoyances like that that just didnt seem to work as well as the Apple stuff Oh and the haptics were nonexistent on the GW6 compared to the AW couldnt feel them at allJust curious if Pixel Phone with Pixel Watch would work better than the experience I had with the GW6 and my Oneplus 8T Thx for the insight","18":"HiI want to use a pixel watch lte for my son who will be only taking his watch to school He has a phone at home that

network on pixel app at paired phone at home when both watch and phone are on wifi I get no operator supported which i think is because my phone has no sim in itWhen I bought the pixel watch lte I thought I would just load a sim card or a regular esim to it but it seems that its not as simple as that for a warchAll above being said can I just get an lte esim plan from a carrier and use on watch if my phone is only wifi phone How do I load esim to watch directly since pixel app is not letting meGemini tells me its possible  but i dont know how and if in canada can i use freedom mobile or

few hours on the phone with them but I was told it was not possible to do with a BYOD device They even attempted to manually activate it but the problem is the phone cant download the eSIM to send

recently endured myself Long story short I recently got a Pixel Google 8 Pro phone I also own four different smartwatches Huawei Puma Diesel and Emporio Armani What started happening is that the messages notifications would disappear before I could even read them on my watch The phone was still okay but it kind of defeated the purpose of having a smartwatch After a lot of trial and error and online searches I finally came across another Reddit post that had this solution so I cant really take credit but its an archived post For whatever reason the Google Pixel Watch app interfered with the Wear OS app also by Google btw so uninstalling it solved the problem First of all I hate it when they preinstall crapps that I dont need And secondly shame on Google for not fixing this problem until now I was actually contemplating about getting a Pixel watch but I will definitely not be buying one now I also may steer clear from their phones in the future PS Heres the link to the other

the voice notes arent backing up as expected  I am using Google One for backups and my phone is a Pixel 9 Pro  All other apps Fitbit Keep notes etc are backing up normally  Both the phone and the watch were ordered directly from Google so there shouldnt be a risk of counterfeit tech hereOddly in recordergooglecomhttprecordergooglecom my account is showing the one test recording I did when I got my previous phone in 2021 but none of the test ones from my new phonewatch  The account is the same so its not a matter of logging in to the wrong accountIn my search to find the fix I came across a lot of mentions to check the backup toggle in the Recorder app on the watch  This article has images of where it is and what its supposed to look likehttpswwwandroidauthoritycompixelwatch3recorderapp3479804  My Recorder app doesnt have anything at all below my recordings  just the red record circle and a list of recordings below it  No backup toggle as in the picsAlso weird  In that same article it mentions that new watches might ship with out of date Recorder versions that were known to be missing some functions  It lists v1020240807660310591 as the one to correct that  I checked my watchs Recorder version v1020241104693595663 which per the naming convention is nearly three months later  So its not thatI tried uninstalling the Recorder app but I could only find options to disable it or remove upgrades  I tried both but no diceHas anyone had this issue  Has anyone stumbled upon a fix  This is so weirdUPDATEWhatever Magical Pixel Dust fixed it randomly for other people seems to have fixed it mostly for mine too  Now both my P9Pro phone and my web Recorder apps show the test messages from my PW3 watch  I did some additional test recordings on my watch and they appeared within moments on both as well The only remaining weirdness is that there is still no backup toggle below the recordings

try for now TLDR I feel like ive been a beta tester for google since the Pixel 6 and upwardsIve been using google phones since the Nexus 6P and instantly fell in love with them The camera of the 6P was ahead of its time especially the ease of use My previous phones were Galaxies and these camera apps always had me take 4 or 5 pics before i snapped the right shot the 6P just made it into a one hit wonder I also loved the clean Android feel and seeing Android be improved to what it is today was an amazing journey Google phones i owned Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel 2 XL the panda 3 Pixel 3 Pixel 4 Pixel 3 again I loved the size Pixel 6  Pixel 8 and pixel watch  budsMy experience with Pixel phones has been outstanding especially in the beginning I was a BIG advocate of using Pixels and shilled them a lot They were a bit hard to come by in Holland at first so id import them Such great phones though I bought a Pixel 4 for my Mom that still works to this day No lag just smooth as butter I also loved the google ecosystem and the design language I still do I think android has really matured and is in so many ways pushing the envelope in smartphone OS development Im trying a different brand now but i do miss a lot of the features that android offers Its so smooth and navigating the phone is superb Universal back gesture now playing flip to DnD flick your wrist to reverse to selfie cam So many nifty ways to interact with your phone i love itThere has been a but in this story for me unfortunately Ever since the Pixel 6 the road has gotten a bit bumpy for me The 6 had strange issues would have excessive battery drain get really hot and have software bugs like apps hanging I loved these phones for the stability and this was getting a bit of an issue Maybe i was just unluckyI hoped it was a 6 issue so i upgraded to the regular 8  pixel watch 2 and this is were it really got crappy for me on the hardware spectrum The 8 had a few software issues like apps hanging when multitasking that i could live with but the hardware started failing me while traveling Japan First my Pixel Watch 2 just stopped charging and died on me out of the blue and a month later my Pixel 8 started getting a weird green screen issue tens of times a day the screen would just turn green and spaz out for a minute Very inconvenient when youre on a Japanese train station trying to figure out where to go Combine that with google maps hanging a lot when in PIP mode and it was beginning to become an annoyance to use the P8 on the roadGoogle supports solution was for them to send the phone in for repair which would mean i would be without a phone for 23 weeks so i was forced to buy a phone in Japan to travel without hassle I realised i kinda lost faith in the stability of my pixel because of my 6 and 8 experience so i decided to switch sides And i feel a bit sad to leave the Pixels behind to be honest I genuinely love these phones ive captured many great memories with em and theyve accompanied me on so many great adventures and never let me down Until recentlyNow having joined the other side still feels weird Its a gorgeous device to look at but i dont think the other brand has a better operating system and in lots of ways i miss my pixels ease of use Switching was not that difficult so i will definitely be back in the future but i really want Google to deliver a more stable hardware experience firstI feel like ive been a beta tester with these last 2 Pixels To get a support solution that involves not having my phone for 2 weeks is also very unsatisfactory And strange as my watch WAS able to be exchanged  but the watch is not really something i cant travel withoutI feel like with googles ambitions being upscaled theyre also upscaling some of the woes these phones have and its reflecting on the quality of my experiences I really hope the 9 will be a succes and makes me wanna jump back into the Pixel experience but i think im gonna skip a few generations Itll be good to fall in love with em again Anyway first world problems eh","66":"Have you ever have this issue  Phone pixel 8Pixel Watch V1Fitbit App premiumI do have different step count on watch 12K vs app phone

while wearing the watch ","197":"","198":"I love going for runs and dont like hauling my phone with me I had the thought that I should get the data plan for my watch and then I had the question could I get the data plan for my pixel watch and then have my phone connect to my watch Kinda reverse their roles but I dont know if watches have a hotspot ability","199":"Any ideas how to fix this Its pretty annoying tbh","200":"I ran 4km this morning I mapped the run on Strava before I went on the run My watch gave me the correct stats for the distance but when I look at it on my phone it says I only ran 335km The checkered flag on the map does not match where I ended my run I finished where I started So confused as to why the data does not transfer from the watch to the phone especially since I do not take the phone on the run with me","201":"","202":"Does anyone know why when I make a call on my watch it make me speak over the phone and not the watch also on the very rare times it does work and I hand up after the call it ends up calling the person again on its own Does anyone know what is happening","203":"","204":"The Google logo is also a night light which is removable for different shades","205":"As the title states I just left the Apple world Now would be a good time to applaud me Ill wait Okay thanks Anyways I could not be happier with my new Google pixel 8a I have so much on my mind and I also have a little adhd so Ill try to stay on track First of all the reason that led me to switching is mainly my iPhone screen and back got severely cracked Especially the back and the camera lens area My daughter threw it a couple times out of frustration she struggles with sensory disorder so thats why shes a little aggressive and the back of my iPhone which is made out of flippin glass not to my surprise shattered Like of course it would bc its made of such a fragile material Yes I had a case on it Well honestly as soon as I saw how bad the damage was I already was drooling at the thought of leaving apple After all back in the day like 15 years ago my first phone was not an iPhone I was always an android girly I believe I got my first iPhone when I was in college I am 30 now and I did have an android cheapie phone 1 time between college and now for ahsort time but mostly it was apple and mostly i stayed with them bc all my family had apple and my husband too But secretly I always liked android way better So I talked to my husband and said look this is more expensive to repair than just buying a new android type phone they are not as expensive as apple He begrudgingly accepted my wish to purchase a new phone and I began my research Many videos and articles later I chose the Google Pixel 8a Everyone was saying its your best bang for your buck and theres not many differences between this cheaper model than the pro model more on that laterwould like to know your thoughts So I bought the phone I also decided to buy a Galaxy watch 6 to go with it as I need a watch I am used to using an appe watch daily I was gonna do the pixel watch but it looked like it was really lacking in features and it had not great reviews I would have loved to go with that so that it was seamless integration but oh well this GW6 works pretty near seamlessly I am thoroughly enjoying my new androidGoogle ecosystem of technology I really love it in fact which is why I am here I genuinely cant see myself ever going back Has anyone else here went from an iPhone to Google pixel Any any tips and tricks you want to share about my phone and also that GW6 would be awesome ","206":"I recently got myself a pixel watch to use alongside my Cat S22 flip phone and I realized that the Pixel Watch app isnt compatible with that phone so I cant use the watch Ive been looking at getting an eink phone for a while now but I want to get one that I know I can use with the smart watch Are there any recommendations","207":"I have a Pixel 8 a Pixel 2 watch and Google Fi cell phone service Ive heard mixed reviews about my Google Fi working reliably in Tokyo and wondered if anyone can point me in the right direction Is it best to get a mobile hot spot I dont want to lose connectivity because Ill need Internet for the trains and to use Google translate Ill be only in Tokyo for about a week Leaving in a month Thanks for your help","208":"I know theres a side loaded apk to get around it but Im more interested in these working together in stock configuration","209":"AmazoncahttpswwwamazoncadpB0C4DGBHY2linkCodell1tag298320linkId4e1a9dbe5a1d0367ee9ce820e8db11f4languageenCArefaslisstl","210":"Does anyone else having issues with smart watch unlocking the phone For most of the time it only works like probably 40 I am using first pixel watch and P7 Pro I am not sure if i am doing something wrong","211":"There is a certain bathroom in my building at work that is always empty Reason being it is out of range of both wifi and cellular I have taken both my Fold 4 and iPhone 13 pro in there multiple times and you will maybe see one bar of LTE but cant ever load web pages Tell me why I was just able to watch a full YouTube video in high quality on the can with my pixel 9 pro Zero issues loading web pages This is an anecdotal experience but wow this modem is the glow up of the century ","212":"Ive had the same issue with the Pixel Watch 2 with two different Pixel 8 Pro phones I have no idea whats going onIt gets stuck in that rectangle with the circle rotating around it Eventually it will say that it cant connect On the phone it will say to factory reset the watch which Ive done a billion timesI got the first Pixel 8 Pro phone with the watch I thought there was an issue with the phone because it kept crashing So I exchanged the phone and got another its still having the pairing issue I exchanged the watch and the new one has the same issue and Im also noticing the second phone is having the crashing issues just to a smaller degreeSo Is it google Has anyone else overcame any of these issues","213":"For anyone who is considering moving I hope this helps I recently switched from the Pixel 8 Pro to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and here are my observationsDisplay The S25 Ultras display is noticeably better in terms of brightness and the antireflective coating It performs exceptionally well under various lighting conditionsSpeakers The speakers on the S25 Ultra are significantly louder than those on the Pixel 8 Pro Initially I thought the Pixel had great audio but this upgrade proved me wrongPerformance  Battery The S25 Ultra outperforms the Pixel 8 Pro in both performance and battery life As a heavy user who frequently takes pictures and watches videos I no longer have to worry about running out of charge while out and aboutsomething I often wished was better on the PixelS Pen This is my first phone with a stylus so I dont really miss the Bluetooth functionality that was removed Im still getting used to it but its a nice additionDesign I wasnt a fan of the sharp corners on previous Samsung Ultra models so I appreciate the rounded edges on this one However I still prefer the Pixel 8 Pros Bay Blue color over the Jade Green I ordered for the S25 Ultra While the Samsung looks premium the Pixel had a cooler aesthetic in my opinionCamera This is where I have mixed feelings The S25 Ultra excels in video recording but for photography Ive noticed some noise in darker areassomething the Pixel handled much better Knowing how powerful Googles image processing is Ill likely install a GCam port to see if that improves the resultsHaptics The haptic feedback on the Pixel is far better than on the S25 Ultra It feels much more precise especially when typing with Gboard or other keyboards Im also disappointed that Samsung still doesnt support face recognition for CTScertified apps like banking applicationsSignal Reception The S25 Ultra has better signal reception than the Pixel 8 Pro thanks to the Snapdragon processorFinal Thoughts Overall this has been a solid upgrade especially considering the tradein value With promotional offers I got around 750 for my yearold Pixel 8 Pro while its actual tradein value was closer to 350 The improvements in display battery life and performance make it worth it but I do miss some of the Pixels strengthsespecially in photography and haptics","214":"I own a Pixel6 phone but just wanted to ensure whether Pixel Watch 2 works with other brands","215":"ETA thanks for everyones input I tried 3 more cases on the recommendations from the comments and Ive ultimately gone with a Spigen Ultra Hybrid httpswwwamazoncoukdpB0CVR3SQCDpsc1case Feels amazing shows off the beautiful mint color of the phone and its got the sturdiness I expect of Spigen  I thought that picking the case was the easy part after the making the decision to spend several hundred  on a new phone I didnt exactly needUnfortunately Ive watched creative cases disappear over the years and my gotos Caseology and Spigen the same company are now pretty much only producing blackgreynavy boring cases or ones with features I dont use like MagSafe and dont want to spend extra money on Am I asking for a lot to have something sturdy and pretty Ive got two toddlers I need something thats going to survive that but do I have to sacrifice it looking niceI bought the Wintergreen Pixel 9 because it is absolutely my favorite color I get that by putting a case over it Id be hiding the color unless I bought the Google case as wellSo I did what any idiot like me with an Amazon Prime account would do and ordered 5 cases including the Google case to compare and decide It really wasnt an easy decision and I thought it would be It came down to a coin or in my case Pop Socket toss ReallyHeres my imgur post of the cases I was deciding betweenhttpsimgurcomasfqN2Tx","216":"So a few days ago I decided that I wanted out of the Apple Eco system and decided that I need shot of my watch phone and Airpod Pros Ive wanted to return to Android for awhile and tried to use the S24 ultra for a month or so last year and couldnt get on with it Grabbed myself a Pixel 9 Pro XL Garmin and Nothing Ear 2024 and couldnt be happier Dont know why I like my Pixel over the S24 Ultra I think its that stock android experience I have just ordered a set of AZ100 earbuds to try but yeah team Pixel ","217":"Spent about 3 hours getting everything dialed  so far so good","218":"I just gotta come here and express my gratitude towards Google for actually fixing and changing the many issues with their previous devices To preface Ive been a long time iPhone user who dabbles with the android ecosystem I used to flipflop back and forth each year between Apple and Google up until the Pixel 4 but then I felt like googles devices couldnt keep up with some of the hardware Apple uses on their devices Most recently I really tried to love the P8P but there was so many issues I couldnt see past that would degrade the experience of the device As with my job I cant really be near a charger at all times one of my main issues was the terrible battery life of the Pixel 8 Pro I wouldnt even make it through an 810 hour shift comfortably with the Pixel 8 Pro And it wasnt solely for screen on time but mainly standby time that was the culprit Of course screen time would degrade my battery life even quicker but as it was in my pocket for a few hours and Id go back onto my phone seeing that it lost 15 percent battery life was extremely unsettling Id constantly limit background usage turn 5G off an use LTE strictly turn off location services And although that helped slightly I dont believe you should limit your phone in a bunch of different ways to be able to prolong battery lifeI always also experienced laggingstuttering issues with the 8 Pro This issue is self explanatory and not much to say other than it seriously degraded the experience of using the phoneOverheating Yeah that was an issue constantly Id be using maps on my car and my phone would have an overheating warning In direct sunlight Id have an overheating warning Etc it was just a constant battle The modem on the 8 Pro was AWFUL Such spotty service dropped calls and again limiting to LTE instead of 5G just to have improvements on the battery life Now with the P9PXL oh my what a drastic difference And of course this is my experience with the device but battery has been amazing The standby times have been excellent no need to limit background usage limit to LTE turn down screen resolution Yesterday I had over 4 hours SOT and the device was still at 50 ish percent battery life by the time I got home I was using the camera maps daily texting phone calls emails social media and this device just handled it so well The modem is crazy good Id argue better than apples I live in the basement of my house and on either the 8 Pro or 15 Pro Max Id get one bar or no bars in my room P9PXL is sitting at 3 bars right now in a room I struggled to have service in Havent experienced a single dropped call using 5G and this modem is killing it allOverheating hasnt been an issue at all This phone remains cool with my usage patterns because of that new vapor chamber Havent had a single overheating issue whether using android auto or just being outside on my deviceStuttering hasnt been an issue at all The UI has been buttery smooth No hiccups or stuttering The new fingerprint sensor works flawlessly Im using a tempered glass screen protector and it just reads my fingerprint without delay Messing around with the add me feature on the camera and the magic eraser its just crazy what AI on a device can do Some of the features are a gimmick in my opinion but some of these features are seriously QOL features With RCS finally available on iPhone well currently to those who have the iOS 18 beta texting between iPhone and Android has been lovely with those read receipts reply features no horribly compressed photosvideos I say this with full confidence but I genuinely feel like this is finally a Pixel year for me Im seriously loving everything about this phone ","219":"I am between the Pro XL and the Pro In the end I decided to go with the Pro Its my first Pixel coming from the Galaxy S22 so I am very excited I also got a Pixel Watch to go with it I am curious to know why others chose the phone size that they got","220":"I love a lot of things about the pixel but as a long time iOS user Im having mild buyers remorse  anxiety I have 8 days left to trade the phone back  Would love some reassurance from longerterm pixel users I will say some stuff I love so far is  Design the Hazel is stellar  Google makes everything easy its well explained and covers most of the bases youd have questions around from switching over  Google ecosystem works great for productivity  Pictures are fun to take and the quality is imo better for the casual enjoyer Customization but wont get into it as everyone knows this already  Google is putting in effort to be consumer friendly while apple recently has been trending opposite Cost to package ratio Some stuff Im having anxiety about  accessories are what I miss most about apple Really liked my Apple watch and airpods I have pixel buds now and they just dont hit how I hoped  unfortunately Im one of the users affected by scroll stutter and lag in many apps like Reddit FB YouTube and instagram makes me feel like the phone is less premium On android 15 Google photos just isnt as seamless as iCloud photos imo it syncs inconsistently for me switching between cameras is VERY choppy  app performance I feel as if the QAQC of 3rd party apps is not up to par with apple the difference between optimization of different apps is noticeable whereas on iOS they are all generally similar to where you dont feel much of a difference ","221":"So this past week I chose to buy a pixel 9 pro256 gb over the Samsung Galaxy 24ultra I was just wondering if I made a mistake or not I got a really good deal The phone and pixel watch 3 45mm for about 1050 including my pixel 6a trade Just wanted to know what people thought Thanks","222":"For all the btching and complaining I did for my Pixel 8 Pro I need to give an updateDespite all the problems I experienced with my Pixel 8 Pro at the 6 month mark it now seems to be stable and working as it should I am getting pretty good battery life dont have to but I charge it usually 1 time during the day and at bedtime app response is good very few issues mostly surroundings certain appsSo I am happy with the phone Pixel Watch 2 and my Pixel buds

daily driver since its release I use it with 5G on screen at full resolution dynamic smooth display refresh rate is on no bluetooth or tethering Brightness left on autoTLDR  Positives  Camera quality great design  display OS with some caveats  Negatives  everything elseThe positives Camera  beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line and this release is no exception Every shot has this mesmerizing Pixel touch and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit Videos are world class too not quite on the level of the iPhone but well get there eventuallyBeautiful and unique design  Its sitting in a clear case and in a sea of generic boring slabs it really stands out and doesnt go unnoticed People often ask me what kind of phone it is most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade nowVery long software support  Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene albeit with the following youll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years so its not really a positiveWorld class display  stellar QHD 120hz panel sharp and brightSleek OS  Android in its purest cleanest form Customization galore However as Ill mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly so I dont know if this count as a positive Now onto the negativesFirst off we must address the elephant in the room Battery life This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast The opposite of what you want right The 10 minutes top ups to 50 is a concept Google seemingly never heard ofYou want half a charge  Better sit  wait half an hour Full charge  Go watch a movie  Now the discharge and this is where the real drama clocks in This phone EATS battery ON IDLEOn your average 9 to 5 workday no camera no games just basic apps youll head home with 15 tops Phone dead by 7pm then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule better not be in a hurryNow try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone  A bit of pictures for work at 10am a short 4K video at 1pm a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm Youre now looking at a 4pm shutdownBut lets go real on the camera after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day Starting at 10 am  pictures videos a bit of editing about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each Shutdown at 1PMThe CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING Throw anything heavy at it and youll head home with a dead phone one that died long before your day was over Simple as thatKeep in mind that this is my experience with a 8monthsold device and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software supportNow we need to talk UI and animations because this isnt good either Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness but not here Actually some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz Switching apps isnt 120hz either nor is scrolling A TON of lags and various frame drops resulting in a framerate like 4090hz never stable with the occasional but very rare peak at 120 This isnt TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023 1159 flagship phone from GoogleThis phone FEELS slow and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so InfuriatingOne day I had to handle a coworkers A54 to tweak a few things I was SHOCKED by the smoothness this was indeed true 120hz which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos midranger I understand the need for a dynamic framerate not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasnt what I had in mindFinally the optical underdisplay fingerprint scanner This my friends is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018  One of the first phones with UDFS The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable still is most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device just in case Well this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro and no optical sensor backup in sightSometimes it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact tosuccessfully fail to unlock After it fails 3 times or so it will ask you to enter your password making onehand unlocks a luck job Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI As for faceunlock I know its there but I disabled it because it doesnt work in the dark no IR sensor and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height without having to raise it to my facePixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis And indeed it does look incredibly cool I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone but Id rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159TLDR  Positives  Camera quality great design  Negatives  everything else","225":"My first Pixel Watch Upgrading from a Galaxy Watch 5 which I never liked very much Im a long time Pixel phone user since Pixel 1 XL but the lack of a 45mm option for the last two Pixel watches made me skip it So far Im really enjoying it Buttery smooth moving through the OS compared to my Galaxy Watch 5 Also the haptics are incredible","226":"I gotta say Im lovin it GWU is just to big and doesnt seem to have as many features when youre not using a Samsung phone Im on the Razr  2024 model I have another band coming on Tuesday and there are a  ton available on Amazon Now to sell the GWU","227":"Ive been in the Samsung Android ecosystem for some time but Im tired of Samsung Galaxy not having the ability to have more than one profile on a phone though theyre fine with doing that on their tabletsI want the ability to have a separate work and personal profile but thats just not possible on any Samsung Galaxy phoneI dont want to leave the Samsung ecosystem since I enjoy their products and I have a Samsung watch and ear buds but it really doesnt look like adding multiple profile options is something theyre going to doBut it seems that Samsung Galaxy seems to have the best camera for an Android phone so I think Im going to have to choose which one I want more Having a good camera is also fairly importantThat being said it really seems that my only options are either Pixel or OnePlus Any thoughts Especially from people who have used the latest models for Galaxy Pixel and OnePlus Or other Android phones I may not have consideredThanks","228":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel Ive noticed several areas where Pixel excels Heres my breakdown\u00a0 Edit Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom due to community rules 1 Advanced Notification System Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and current playback in the notification center notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful Intuitive notification management eg disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app\u00a0 2 Clear Interactive System Information Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone Alarm volume feedback when you miss an alarm it shows you that volume of your alarm is low Reminder to close Incognito pages after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on\u00a0 3 Robust File Management PClike file system with enhanced filtering All your documents from whatever app you use you will find it in the documents tap Same for images Its universal same as the PC Because files controls all Its better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0 4 Enhanced User Interface Google search bar on home screen and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS Maybe because its older feature so Its much adopted You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and Im addicted to it right now Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for nonnative English speakers\u00a0 5 Multimedia and Connectivity More practical PictureinPicture PiP functionality Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay especially for web pages and not so popular website Specially in background continuity of the casting You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet\u00a0 6 Communication Features Full call history logs Easy one here iPhone \u00a0 7 Customization and Productivity Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature Specially you can pin you copies for ever The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it In this way you will have bigger windows but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as its on chrome browser on windows Its fast accurate and never disappoint you Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons\u00a0 8 App Availability I dont why but Android in general have collection of not wellknown apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use For example in Android in IPTV 9stream You cannot find similar app on iPhone Downloading apps from outside the Play store gives you the freedom you have on windows\u00a0 9 Device Analysis Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights Part 2 why iOS in some parts outperform Android PixelNow the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel 1 Better Face UnlockiOSs Face ID is still the best in class Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure For example it cannot verify your wallet payment 2 Unified Call HistoryHaving all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important I know some users hate this feature but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work 3 Spotlight SearchSpotlight search is the Feature No 1 that I wish android has One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device even files documents photos For example if you swipe down and type passport iOS will give you the passport document in Files app in addition to the Passport screenshots photos in your Photos app 4 Text Cursor ControlHold space to move the cursor making text editing easier Better than the one in Gboard 5 Privacy in TrackingBetter control and transparency over app tracking 6 VPN in SafariBuiltin VPN support while Google Ones VPN isnt available in my country 7BestinClass AccessoriesAir Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone  For example If I wear the AirPods while Im watching Youtube in the Apple TV notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone neat featureAlso you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone 8 Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight 9CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay Carplay is far more stable and reliable I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado and I never having it disconnected from the car In Android two three times a week 10Touch Screen QualityI dont why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel Its more accurate and shorter response time 11 Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devicesThis is an important point Document folder in iOS iCloud is the same on all Apple devices So without uploading or backing up files If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple

so all my services are dependant on my Google mail ID Used iOS because it felt more mature than Samsungs cartoonish UI at least back in 2016era Tried Google Pixel 3 XL but traumatized due to the RAM management issues so switched completely to iOS and used iPhones for a WHILE I tried every Pixel from the 6series but returned due to lackluster performance Apples own apps legit felt like bloat on iOS because all I ever used was Google apps including Google Podcasts RIPBut now completely shifted into Google ecosystem with Pixel Watch 3 45mm and 9 Pro XL Loving it so far True bloatfree experience great cameras a bit slow but good and awesome Ui","230":"My pixel 2 died last year and I had to scramble to get a new phone by the end of the weekendSure the 7 is nice I like the battery saving features its fast and the camera and screen are great but this phone sucks in comparisonI miss the squeeze feature to get my assistant I miss the fingerprint scanner in the backThis new scanner is hot trash and doesnt detect my fingerprint nearly as accurately My pixel 2 was accurate almost every time as long as my finger wasnt wet or dirty AND you could access your drop down menu easily by scrolling your finger on the scanner I need 2 hands to do that nowI miss my old assistant and voice to text It may be because of an Android update but the new assistant isnt as good the voice to text is ALWAYS WRONG I CANT TRUST IT EVERMy old phone was super accurate with voice to text it rarely betrayed me like this phone does and last November it didnt even sing me happy birthday in the morning like my old phone didToday my assistant kicked on for no reason at work Nobody was talking it just activated like I said Hey Google and my old phone never did thatOh and now I cant even hold the home button for my assistant Who thought that was a good idea The option isnt even there they just took it awayThese are little things but they add up My biggest gripe though is a two part1 The phone is HEAVY with a decent case its like twice the weight of my Pixel 2 Kickstands on this phone are super handy to take weight off of your fingers and prop up the phone but2 The cases are garbage Sure the case itself is fine but they dont make cases with a good kickstands Ive been through 2 in less than a year with delicate use and they break like the cheap pieces of garbage that they are This past weekend I pulled my phone out of my pocket and the kickstand came off completelyGoogle is apparently doing what Apple does and making so you have to buy their brand for accessories tooI wanted to get a dongle to watch youtube videos on my TV with my phone because I use an adblock browser fight me and I dont want the ads that come with Chromecast but these newer phones are incompatible with dongles that let you do thatThis will probably be my last pixel phone Im very disappointed with Googles business decisions and going along with the planned obsolescence like everyone else Every generation seems like they take away good features and add unnecessary ones I like smart lens I like adaptive charging but they didnt need to get rid of everything else to add thoseI got 5 good years out of my Pixel 2 before it had any issues only to be reminded that newer isnt always better  EditI fully expected to get blasted into downvote hell and told that Im wrong Im glad reddit agrees with me on something","231":" EDIT The Android 15 update has improved scrolling a lot apps like Messages Playstore and Spotify are noticeably smoother Its now around 99 of the way there compared to the S23 SD 8

it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area While i do this job i have multiple things running navigation with google maps bluetooth audio to the car all the time some calls bluetooth as well  maybe 5 min per hour work an app to warn me for dangers on the road everything while using 5G mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving sunny day so max brightness often almost all the time smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well no charging opportunities i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patternsConsidering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this The battery was basically getting fried and after app 5h of work the phone dropped from 100 to at best 35 When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15 at the 6h mark which was definitely annoyingComparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day I had zero lags the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 45h tour with 65 of battery At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40 i guess So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall no idea how i would notice but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blastIf you have further questions feel free to ask trying my best to answer it","233":"I would regard myself as a tech guy My phone plan allowed me to switch to a new phone as often as I want I have tried alot of android brands OnePlus Samsung Moto previous Pixel phones Each time I found myself switching back to the iPhone due to various reasons including app optimization camera quality audio quality software etc I just felt like iPhone was the most well rounded phone Having switched to the Pixel 9 Pro I genuinely feel like google hit the mark with this phone Camera quality is seriously amazing Friends and family will literally ask me to take pictures for them after seeing pictures Ive previously taken  Problems Ive had with previous generations of Pixel phones have been directly addressed including cell reception problems audio sounding tinny fingerprint scanner being slow  The AI features have been tossed around as gimmicky but I genuinely use them so much For instance Ive been wanting to try more foods so Ill literally ask Gemini to create me a spicy Indian dish with chicken and add all ingredients to my list along with instructions on how to cook and itll do it effortlessly Using the AI Live feature as job interview prep has been amazing Itll ask me questions and rate my responses I actually used Add me on a family trip this weekend and it worked effortlessly App optimization seems to have improved I use Snapchat and Instagram stories alot and the camera is great on there as well Although iphone is definitely better I feel like theres finally an established ecosystem The watch is much improved with the addition of a bigger size Ive had the buds 3 for about a week and theyve been nothing but great Although not directly related to Google RCS becoming more mainstream has made messaging iPhone users significantly better  If youre on the fence on switching  Id suggest on doing so I have a feeling youre worried about missing iMessage FaceTime and the camera quality But the new additions have not made me thing about this once  Ive had this phone for a month and have loved every bit  I actually went full send and purchased the watch as well as the buds Full ecosystem If you have any questions about the switch let me know ","234":"My phone was at 50 Watch at 79Phone dropped to 45Watch was at 97","235":"Just wanted to drop my thoughts on the Pixel 8 Pro after coming from an iPhone 15 Pro Max Im really tired of Apples walled garden and not being able to install whatever I want so I decided to give Android another shot Last time I used Android was with the S8 and Pixel 4 and while I loved the OS the apps just werent as good as iOSFast forward to now and honestly Im disappointed with the Pixel 8 Pro I actually liked the Pixel 4 better maybe it was the form factor or Android 12 but it just felt right in ways that the P8P doesnt The OS now is fine but not great though I really liked the home screen with the Microsoft launcher But man the apps on Android are still a mess Everythings buggy and Android 15 14 feels worse than 12 in a lot of ways Notifications are a pain the lock screen is dumb and not as customizable as iOS which is just crazy Trying to play a song from Spotify on my Sonos speakers almost gave me an ulcer What really made me want to go back to iOS was the Pixel Watch That thing is trashits small buggy laggy and the apps barely work The photos from the P8P were fantastic so no complaints there as expected Pixel Buds Pro were really good again no complaints there But overall I was just let down and really wanted it to be better Im so over iOS and Apples way of squeezing money out of you for everything but I might try the P10 or P11 and see if things improve by then Sorry if youve heard this kind of thing a million times just wanted to share for anyone else whos thinking the same switch","236":"Hi Im trying to upgrade my phone And these are the only options that appeal to me Id like a phone

months as well  No monthly fee even because thats a Fi perk free Pixel Watch servicePlease help before I order am I crazy not to order this","238":"Edit As pointed out by some users Ive corrected a few things Oct 2021  I ordered a Google Pixel 4a  Main Selling Points Affordability Camera and Unlimited Storage Backup for Google PhotosThe phone had no issues whatsoever at this point untilJan2025  I get a mail from Google  image attached below stating that the Pixel 4a will receive an automatic software update that will dramatically degrade its battery performance and the reason for this update is to improve the phones stability For the record my phone had been working as smoothly as it could I had no issues that would require such a severe update  To tackle this battery issue Google gave us some solutions eligibility based on IMEI number and country image attached below 1 Get a free Battery Replacement2 Get 50 or an equivalent amount of money3 Get 100 or an equivalent amount of money as credit on Google Store that you can use to buy Google Pixel Although I dont see this option anymore on the websiteLate Jan 2025  I get the update and now the phone is no exaggeration UNUSABLE My phone now takes hours and hours to even get from 10 to 50 If I open Youtube for suppose 7 min the phone now drains 7 lmao The only time I could use my phone was when it was plugged into a charger and to top all of that my phones battery has now started to swell  After all of this I was forced to make a choice  The Catch  Thinking about which option I should opt for I found out that except for option 2 the customer is going to get played no matter what they go for1 Whether you go for free Battery Replacement there will be some hidden charges that will be levied on you my experience below2 Or if you opt for a 100 Google Store credit you can only use it to purchase those Google Pixel models that are not on sale that means you cannot buy whichever Pixel you wish to3 Or if you decide to downgrade your software to its previous version then good luck finding one because Google deleted every single one of its older firmware for Pixel 4a  Free Battery Replacement my experience  Before sending my phone for replacement I made some proof videos attached below showing my phones condition  I sent my phone to F1 Info Solution and Services Indore India provided by Google which acted as a mediator between me and Googles Replacement Center Delhi India  After looking at my phone the people at F1 Info Solutions conferred that my phones back panel had been damaged and they would have to now replace it too no other workarounds They said Id have to pay the cost for the back panel plus their service charges I agreed and they sent my phone to the Replacement Center Delhi  Today I get a mail from them attached below and theyve quoted Rs4480 52 for the back panel and Rs1500 17 as their service charge Surprising how things can go from Free to Rs6000 70For the record my phone wasnt swollen before the update It was due to the Software update that the phones battery swole up and my back panel got damagedAfter all of this drama there are now a few questions that Google needs to answer1 What was the need for a stability update when things were running just fine2 Why are only pixel 4a in certain countries eligible for a free battery replacement and other programs3 Why did you delete all the software updates prior to this one4 If you knew this update was going to severely affect the phones battery why did you go ahead with it5  and most importantly Why do you want Google Pixel 4a off the market because lets be real all of these are just tactics by Google to get rid of Pixel 4a  The ConspiracyHere are a few reasons I can think of why all of this might be happening1 Fault with Pixel 4a Battery in production Google might have realized that there were some faults with the batteries they installed in 4a and in the future these phones might cause serious hazards or worse blow up2 Getting rid of Lifetime Unlimited Backup Storage Google Pixel 4a is one of last phones by Google that supports Lifetime Unlimited Google Backup Storage for photos and videos Out of all the phones by Google that supports unlimited storage Pixel 4a might be the most active one no sourceMy VerdictGoing forward I dont have a lot of trust in Google Phones Contrary to where I stand today I vouched a lot for Google Pixels before I even convinced a few of my relatives to buy Google Pixel As far as my Pixel 4a is concerned I think Ill opt for the 50 optionAnyone with Google Pixel 4a please share

played around with a few of the newer ones recently in store and liked the design and software What are some of the things you miss after switching What are some of the reasons you chose to switch One of my main concerns is I am a big privacy buff and I am not sure how privacy friendly a Pixel can be without some custom adjustmentsEDIT damn so many replies wow just adding this here which may change

opinions but I wanted to share my experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL after using it for almost 10 days At first I was super excited like everyone else When I got the phone my initial thought was that it looked amazing I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor The phone did get pretty hot during setup but thats probably normalI transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver Unfortunately the very next day I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store I realized the connectivity wasnt much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro The phone switched to 3G and the data speed dropped dramatically making it almost unusable I quickly checked my wifes iPhone 15 Pro Max and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer Even phone calls were choppyThe next day I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra and there wasnt any issue Fast forward a couple of days and we went on a trip with our kids My wife and I took lots of pictures  me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone On the small screens everything looked fine but when we reviewed the photos on a computer oh man the Pixels portrait shots were way worse The edge detection was awful and the kids skin looked weirdly smoothed out like they had makeup on to hide imperfections The other pictures were okay maybe comparable to the iPhonesThe final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling Twitter also acted up often failing to load pictures and videos I had to forceclose and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properlySorry but it just doesnt feel like a premium phone Google should either offer a better price or better specs In my opinion this phone is worth no more than 600 euros not 1200 I know Ill probably get a lot of downvotes for this post but this is my experience and personal view I really wanted to like the phone and

Thank you for any insights ","261":"Hey Pixel ownersJust wanted to share my experience using Google phones for a decade and also why i decided to give another brand a try for now TLDR I feel like ive been a beta tester for google since the Pixel 6 and upwardsIve been using google phones since the Nexus 6P and instantly fell in love with them The camera of the 6P was ahead of its time especially the ease of use My previous phones were Galaxies and these camera apps always had me take 4 or 5 pics before i snapped the right shot the 6P just made it into a one hit wonder I also loved the clean Android feel and seeing Android be improved to what it is today was an amazing journey Google phones i owned Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel 2 XL the panda 3 Pixel 3 Pixel 4 Pixel 3 again I loved the size Pixel 6  Pixel 8 and pixel watch  budsMy experience with Pixel phones has been outstanding especially in the beginning I was a BIG advocate of using Pixels and shilled them a lot They were a bit hard to come by in Holland at first so id import them Such great phones though I bought a Pixel 4 for my Mom that still works to this day No lag just smooth as butter I also loved the google ecosystem and the design language I still do I think android has really matured and is in so many ways pushing the envelope in smartphone OS development Im trying a different brand now but i do miss a lot of the features that android offers Its so smooth and navigating the phone is superb Universal back gesture now playing flip to DnD flick your wrist to reverse to selfie cam So many nifty ways to interact with your phone i love itThere has been a but in this story for me unfortunately Ever since the Pixel 6 the road has gotten a bit bumpy for me The 6 had strange issues would have excessive battery drain get really hot and have software bugs like apps hanging I loved these phones for the stability and this was getting a bit of an issue Maybe i was just unluckyI hoped it was a 6 issue so i upgraded to the regular 8  pixel watch 2 and this is were it really got crappy for me on the hardware spectrum The 8 had a few software issues like apps hanging when multitasking that i could live with but the hardware started failing me while traveling Japan First my Pixel Watch 2 just stopped charging and died on me out of the blue and a month later my Pixel 8 started getting a weird green screen issue tens of times a day the screen would just turn green and spaz out for a minute Very inconvenient when youre on a Japanese train station trying to figure out where to go Combine that with google maps hanging a lot when in PIP mode and it was beginning to become an annoyance to use the P8 on the roadGoogle supports solution was for them to send the phone in for repair which would mean i would be without a phone for 23 weeks so i was forced to buy a phone in Japan to travel without hassle I realised i kinda lost faith in the stability of my pixel because of my 6 and 8 experience so i decided to switch sides And i feel a bit sad to leave the Pixels behind to be honest I genuinely love these phones ive captured many great memories with em and theyve accompanied me on so many great adventures and never let me down Until recentlyNow having joined the other side still feels weird Its a gorgeous device to look at but i dont think the other brand has a better operating system and in lots of ways i miss my pixels ease of use Switching was not that difficult so i will definitely be back in the future but i really want Google to deliver a more stable hardware experience firstI feel like ive been a beta tester with these last 2 Pixels To get a support solution that involves not having my phone for 2 weeks is also very unsatisfactory And strange as my watch WAS able to be exchanged  but the watch is not really something i cant travel withoutI feel like with googles ambitions being upscaled theyre also upscaling some of the woes these phones have and its reflecting on the quality of my experiences I really hope the 9 will be a succes and makes me wanna jump back into the Pixel experience but i think im gonna skip a few generations Itll be good to fall in love with em again Anyway first world problems eh","262":"","263":"So Ive been using the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for a day now and Im pretty happy with them overall Heres the breakdown  Comfort  Fit These things are TINY  Way smaller than the first gen and they feel great in my ears Havent had any issues with them falling out even during runs  Sound Quality The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro  Its clear and balanced and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds Ive been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles wont like these but I disagree The profile is flat and natural Things sound how theyre supposed to sound like a mostly true studio quality You can turn the bass up if you need more  ANC Noise cancellation is solid Its on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds my previous daily driver and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear  Transparency Mode  This is where they really shine Transparency mode is fantastic  it feels super natural almost like youre not wearing earbuds at all This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many Ive tried these are hands down the best  Multipoint Works seamlessly  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues  Case The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original which is a nice touch The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case  Mics Mic quality is very clear  Touch controls Basically no difference here Ive never had issues with the touch controls on previous generationsOverallThe Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original Theyre comfortable sound great and have excellent transparency mode  If youre looking for a pair

issue drives me crazy Ive owned a pair of Pixel Buds Pros for over two years However about half the time they do not reconnect to my phone Oppo A78 when I remove them from the case and put them in my ears When this happens the Buds turn on but there is no chime sound to indicate a successful pairing and audio continues to play through my phone speakers If I wait eventually a connection is formed after about a minute or two \u00a0The only thing that seems to speed this up is manually disabling my phones Bluetooth and then reenabling it while I am waiting for the connection to form When I do this the Buds pair automatically and instantlyIt appears totally random whether or not the connection will be successful The only trend I have observed is that the pairing tends to work better when I am at home and worse when I am away from homeWhen I first got the Pixel Buds I had a different phone Motorola Moto G9 and thought it was a problem with the phone However after getting a new phone Oppo A78 in 2023 I continued to experience the same problem and deduced it must be the Pixel Buds I RMAd them with Google and received a brandnew pair To my horror the new Buds exhibit the exact same issueI use several other Bluetooth devices with my phone and dont have the same issue with any of themI have tested the Buds albeit not extensively on nonAndroid devices iOS Windows and I havent managed to replicate the issue so I think it is some sort of Android issueI have tried the following\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Resetting network and Bluetooth

context I as the owner of the pixel buds pro 2 cannot even connect to them while theyre closed to play the lost device chime So of course I have questions related to this 1 How and Why is this possible Because this is a major security issue  2 Is there any way to lock other phones out from seeing my devices live location 3 And this is the more brand damaging part of this Why can an iOS device have more control over my Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 than I do with my own pixel 9 pro I cannot even play the chime from my latest pixel 9 pro phone but my friends iPhone 13 canAnyways Id love to

my 2000 songs2 A native photo  video gallery with decent features Google photos is great to store and search images but lacking my most used feature of Samsung Gallery  Press and hold anywhere on an image and it attempts to auto select what you pointed at and if selected properly you could save it as a new image or copy  share it directly3  The Pixel Camera app doesnt allow me to control exposure just by holding somewhere to focus and then lowering it like Apple or Samsung Camera app and I havent found a way to do itThats it I dont regret my change but of course Im a little sad for having

switching over  Google ecosystem works great for productivity  Pictures are fun to take and the quality is imo better for the casual enjoyer Customization but wont get into it as everyone knows this

app optimization camera quality audio quality software etc I just felt like iPhone was the most well rounded phone Having switched to the Pixel 9 Pro I genuinely feel like google hit the mark with this phone Camera quality is seriously amazing Friends and family will literally ask me to take pictures for them after seeing pictures Ive previously taken  Problems Ive had with previous generations of Pixel phones have been directly addressed including cell reception problems audio sounding tinny fingerprint scanner being slow  The AI features have been tossed around as gimmicky but I genuinely use them so much For instance Ive been wanting to try more foods so Ill literally ask Gemini to create me a spicy Indian dish with chicken and add all ingredients to my list along with instructions on how to cook and itll do it effortlessly Using the AI Live feature as job interview prep has been amazing Itll ask me questions and rate my responses I actually used Add me on a family trip this weekend and it worked effortlessly App optimization seems to have improved I use Snapchat and Instagram stories alot and the camera is great on there as well Although iphone is definitely better I feel like theres finally an established ecosystem The watch is much improved with the addition of a bigger size Ive had the buds 3 for about a week and theyve been nothing but great Although not directly related to Google RCS becoming more mainstream has made messaging iPhone users significantly better  If youre on the fence on switching  Id suggest on doing so I have a feeling youre worried about missing iMessage FaceTime and the camera quality But the new additions have not made me thing about this once  Ive had this phone for a month and have loved every bit  I actually went full send

whatever I want so I decided to give Android another shot Last time I used Android was with the S8 and Pixel 4 and while I loved the OS the apps just werent as good as iOSFast forward to now and honestly Im disappointed with the Pixel 8 Pro I actually liked the Pixel 4 better maybe it was the form factor or Android 12 but it just felt right in ways that the P8P doesnt The OS now is fine but not great though I really liked the home screen with the Microsoft launcher But man the apps on Android are still a mess Everythings buggy and Android 15 14 feels worse than 12 in a lot of ways Notifications are a pain the lock screen is dumb and not as customizable as iOS which is just crazy Trying to play a song from Spotify on my Sonos speakers almost gave me an ulcer What really made me want to go back to iOS was the Pixel Watch That thing is trashits small buggy laggy and the apps barely work The photos from the P8P were fantastic so no complaints there as expected Pixel Buds Pro were really good again no complaints there But overall I was just let down and really wanted it to be better Im so over iOS and Apples way of squeezing money out of you for everything but I might try the P10 or P11 and see if things improve by then Sorry if youve heard this kind of thing a million times just wanted to share for anyone else whos thinking the same switch","311":"This to me is a deal

airpods dbrand doesnt have anything casetify doesnt there is nothing I feel like the pixel buds are big enough since they will do other google products but why are the products for pixel buds out there so limited I had this feeling last year but thought I would wait a bit but this year around its still barren out thereThe only ones I have been able to find are expensive leather cases which is fine but not much room for personalization Hell I saw personalized cases for some of those cheaper 20 skullcandy buds before I saw a good one for the pixels EDIT I have elected to start a support group just for people who want more variety in their pixel Bud Pro cases Away from this elitist no pixel Bud rhetoric Give me personalization Damn it","313":"Made the decision to get the buds and love it My first experience on earbuds with noise cancelation and pass through features and love it Should of made the jump on these when I got my pixel 9 but I instead got the watch First time Ive been brand loyal to a company I do not have any regrets The sound is decent enough  since Ive been using iems mostly","314":"had an earlier post about some minor drama with getting mine but they FINALLY came in last night thoughts so farLOVE the smaller size so much honestly if that were the only change made to them Id be happy loved the first gen pros but personally I have small ears so they stuck out of my ears quite a bit these have a lower profile which just looks better love this aesthetic of little white discs in my earsfit is SO much better first gen would fit ok and ive worn them for hours at a time with no problem but if I were ever working out in them or even just eating a lot theyd slowly come out of my ears which was annoying these stay rock solid in my ears so far even light tugs dont make them come out the twisttoadjust stabilizer thing actually seems kinda useful I can see mysellf actually wearing these around my house way more often now switched back to using medium ear tips cuz of the better fit used the small ones on the first gen to get it further in my ear due to its larger sizeweird quirk about the smaller size the touch surface area is smaller and based on how they fit in my ears positioned different than the first gen so touch controls felt kinda awkward at first and I missed the surface a few times especially volume swiping I suspect Ill get used to this after a few daysweeksANC is def more powerful granted Ive only tested them in my room so I havent fully tested them outside but my first gen would bring my ceiling fan to a very low hum these ones eliminate my ceiling fan completely I was caught off guard how quiet my room became transparency mode seems solid too but my voice sounds a bit more robotic than the previous gen again gonna try more today and might update this later also smoother transitions between anctransparencyconversation detection seems better detects when I STOP talking better it seems might turn this off later but Ill try it for a bit turned it off for the first genthe sound effects are more pleasant connecting audio switching etc and feel more thought out also audio switching works way better AND smarter when connected to my phone  watch and I turn on my Chromebook it knows to disconnect from my watch and to my Chromebook and not disconnect from my phoneand of course they sound good out of box sound is super neutral which maybe be fine for most but feels kinda lacking for me personally luckily the EQ makes up for it and now they sound great never had any issues with sound from the first pros and idk if they even sound better per se but theyre solid nonetheless I put my EQ preference above in case u wanna try itthese are super early thoughts and Ill actually be out and about using them today to put them through their paces but already I think Ill like these a lot and be using them ALL the time ","315":"It never was a mindblowing phone but it was a well round phone to begin with And it is still true after 2 years of useFirst what I like the most is the fact I only need to deal with Google Account that I use for Gmail and Youtube anyways No seperate Apple or Samsung account needed Second the battery degradation has been minimal which was not the case for all phones I have used It was acceptable to begin with and it is still acceptable Maybe that is because it has 5000mah and I am not feeling any effect of degradation Third Pixel Buds Pro Again it is not the greatest in term of sound quality and it simply works extremely well with my pixel and iphone with no glitch Fourth monthly security updates and first to try newest Android Something you cannot take granted in the world of Android Most samsung phone waited until late Dec 2023 for A14 For A15 it will not be until next yearI think my P7P will be strong for another two years before I consider upgrading","316":"So Ive been using the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for a day now and Im pretty happy with them overall Heres the breakdown  Comfort  Fit These things are TINY  Way smaller than the first gen and they feel great in my ears Havent had any issues with them falling out even during runs  Sound Quality The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro  Its clear and balanced and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds Ive been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles wont like these but I disagree The profile is flat and natural Things sound how theyre supposed to sound like a mostly true studio quality You can turn the bass up if you need more  ANC Noise cancellation is solid Its on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds my previous daily driver and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear  Transparency Mode  This is where they really shine Transparency mode is fantastic  it feels super natural almost like youre not wearing earbuds at all This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many Ive tried these are hands down the best  Multipoint Works seamlessly  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues  Case The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original which is a nice touch The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case  Mics Mic quality is very clear  Touch controls Basically no difference here Ive never had issues with the touch controls on previous generationsOverallThe Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original Theyre comfortable sound great and have excellent transparency mode  If youre looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone these are a great optionLet me know if you have any questions","317":"So I received my Pixel Buds Pro 2 yesterday and after playing around with them for a bit Im seriously unimpressed They sound pretty good in normal mode no ANCtransparency just passive noise isolation but when I enable ANC or transparency it sounds super tinny and sibilant sounds are super harsh Is this just my pair Or has anyone else experienced this Im just wondering if I should go through customer support to get a replacement pair or wait until a firmware update to address the problem ThanksEdits1 Ive performed a factory reset on the buds and set them up again but the issue still persists2 I am currently using them with my Pixel 9 Pro and Ive been using my Soundcore Liberty 4 NCs with it for about a month before I got my Pixel Buds with no issues3 I have tried my Pixel Buds with different genres of music and EQ settings and have gone between them and my Soundcore Liberty 4 NCs for comparison The sound curves between the 2 are obviously very different but thats how I was able to confirm the significant loss in audio quality when ANCtransparency are enabled4 Toggling spatial audio onoff made no difference in audio quality when in ANCtransparency mode5 Restarting my phone did not resolve the issue6 Ive decided to return my earbuds and wait to get a new pair until these QA issues are resolvedmitigated Thank you to everyone who contributed their experiencessuggestions under this

usually music my left bud suddenly stops playing Sound keeps playing on the right one and both stay connected to my phone Pixel 8a latest stable version Android 15 Touching the bud still pauses the music noise cancellation still works but no sound It sometimes comes back if I pause then play then pause multiple times or play with random settings such as noise cancellation but sometimes the only workaround is to put it back in the suitcase for a few seconds Also both buds seems a bit slow to process commands when it happens  It can happen 4 times a day and then no issue another day Did a factory reset nothing changed It seems like it appeared after the last update release 3144Anyone has been experiencing thisEDIT  its been a while now still happening Support was not helpful Plot twist today the issue changed sides all of a sudden and it happened with my right bud I suspect a connectivity issue with multiple devices used my buds for two days without my pixel watch connected and the problem didnt show up Took my watch with me today and it happened again Ill try with and without it for the week and let you know a similar issue had happened before in Android 14 and was only patched two months later with Android 15SECOND EDIT  was hoping some fixes with Android 15 QPR2 but nothing Im pretty sure the bug only happens when my phone is connected to my pixel watch while playing on my buds Connectivity issue again","324":"LONG POSTI know there have been loads of posts asking this question so I thought I would let you know my experiences of running a Pixel 9 Pro XL and iPhone 15 Pro Max in tandem for a month and what I have noticedPlease note these are just my opinions and observations some may be wrong and I just havent discovered ways of doing things yet  I also ran an Apple Watch Ultra and Pixel Watch 3 since release day too so will mention those at the endTLDR   Both phones have plusses and minuses and both are excellent you wont be disappointed with either Watches AW Ultra has a better battery and is tougher but more expensive than the PW3 but the PW3 seems better at tracking sleep and fitness for me see comment about HR readings on UltraiPhone iOS18 observationsTap top of screen to scroll up is a feature I really miss on the Pixel  Its so useful note I am aware of the android app that does this but its flaky and crapPlaying music hands free using Siri  if Im cooking I can tell Siri to play music and it does it  Pixel Gemini wont as it says it needs to be unlocked first Very irritating  There is a workaround for this which is to use your Pixel Watch if you have one as an extended unlock item and use your home address as extended unlock but there shouldnt need to beAdd reminders handsfree using Siri  same as above  I can tell Siri to add a reminder about something and it does it every time pretty much perfectly  Pixel again asks to be unlocked firstAdd locationbased reminders hands free using Siri  can ask Siri to remind me to do something when I get home  I have no idea what Gemini is doing here  Most of the time it just says it cant do that but occasionally it says it has done it but nothing happens  And very occasionally it adds a Google keep reminder that doesnt announce itself but is there  This is my biggest bugbear with GeminiCustomising lock screen better on my iPhone in my opinion  I love swiping for different colours looks and backgrounds interfacing with my photos and stuff  And I LOVE the multicoloured timeUsing collections of images as lock screen pictures  this is such a brilliant feature I was astonished to find Google no longer do this  I can make a folder of family photos and have them swap on my lock screen Why cant Pixel again yes Im aware there is software for this but I havent managed to find one thats free that works the same without ads or isnt flaky etcInteraction generally between calendar reminders and Siri is just more flexible and powerful than on the Pixel  Every option I need is on there  Location based reminders repeating adding locations with a link to Maps everything  Pixels is a bit of a mess and tasks is so limited BafflingBouncing animated photos  where you can get a topshot image eg short video and select it to bounce back and forth This can produce some really cool effects and looks good in the photos app  Not possible on PixelCopy and paste from phone to MacBookiPad and viceversa  This is such a handy feature and I use it all the time  Obviously Pixel is unable to do thisAirPlay to my Sonos speakers in Apple Music Yes Im a weirdo and use AM not Spotify  I love being able to cast to speakers through AM not the Sonos app Yes I know Spotify can cast to any Sonos speakers though which AM cant natively so this is a bonus for PixelThe Journal app  I actually use this and there is no equivalent Pixel app as default happy to hear peoples recommendations here for one which works with iOSAndroidWiFi QR codesshare WiFi password  this is new in iOS18 and is really handy as it works cross platform As far as I know it isnt on PixelSafari reading mode  I hate adverts I mean I really really HATE modern advertising  So I use this feature all the time  Pixel does not have it But actually Pixel has a better solution to this with an app from Google  See my comments on my Pixel listRemoving annoying ads in Safari  another iOS18 feature God I love this Just delete all those shitty irritating adverts and read in peace Works in MacOS tooMeasurements tool  I use this quite a lot in my job and its great  I work in Health and Safety and often need to measure room sizes  The measure tool works really well Image crop to screen size  another small but neat feature  If you zoom in on an image to fill the screen a box comes up asking you if you want to crop the image to make a perfect wallpaper sized imageSwipe down to search is much much more comprehensive than Swipe up to search in Pixel I use this feature a lot and its great  In fact I use this to do almost everything  You can search for videos photos by person or by subject eg dog beach York Minster etc music emails images apps news stories anything  Its brilliant  The Pixel one is just really really limitedKeyboard space bar moved cursor in any direction on the Apple keyboard the Google one only moves left and right This is tedious and annoying when the spelling or change is at the start of the message and fruitlessly tapping close to it is annoying  Apples solution is just better hereNote on keyboards I have come to realise that I used to endlessly moan about the Apple keyboard and how annoying it was but the Pixel one is as bad for me so it must be down to my swiping inaccuracy in the main There is no noticeable difference for me between themNight view mode in landscape at night is great and works really well as a bedside clock  And a wave of the hand brings up the time in red at night if you wake up  Really nice featureCalendar entries If you ask Siri to tell you your calendar entries it will tell you all of them including shared calendar entries Gemini can only tell you Google calendar entries  Siri is pretty shitty generally but this is one area it really nailsApple Pay is less faffy and seems far more reliable than Google Pay for me so far I seem to keep having to unlock my Google Pay and reswiping every time  And if I have a store card it just gets completely confused  And I often have to fish around to get the machine to read my phone  Apple Pay just works logically and perfectly every single timeApple fitness on the watch works really well with synchronising exercise and videos together setting reminders to work out and so on  Just really well thought outScreen attention and by extension face unlock is much better on the iPhone Pixel locks the screen if I am wearing my reading glasses or in a dark room sometimesNow for my Pixel observationsNote these are for Google Pixel Pro 9 XL and Android 14Now playing on the lock screen is brilliant for a music fan like me Just love love love this featureNow Playing list saving all music it has heard and having a shortcut on the home screen  So I dont even need to pay attention now I can take a look later at what the song was  Such a cool featureWatch later for YouTube suggestions previews in Netflix accessed directly from notifications  This is brilliant and so much easier than ApplesNotifications are a bit better generally but I  particularly love YouTube suggestions that I can cast to my TV by a single tap from the notification or adding something to a watch list suggestion from Three BBC etcReplying directly to messages from the notifications is great too  Apple just doesnt do thisCast to my Sonos speakers in Spotify I dont use it but my daughter does and its really cool to cast in the Spotify app to any Sonos speakers iPhone can only cast to some of my Sonos speakers not all of themGemini generally better than Siri by a mile except having to unlock phone nonsense and points mentioned above regarding calendar and location based reminders etc Its such a shame it isnt all integrated properly because it frankly makes Siri look embarrassing for most stuff  Night and day better for asking about events places facts news stories pretty much anything Siris Ive found this on the web is embarrassing and its not going to be until at least first Quarter 2025 before it improvesPixel screenshots is really handy too just started using this and find it useful  Its great you can create reminders from it as well but why does it not back it all up  AnnoyingNight Sight camera is amazing  Four minute long exposure images very coolNot sure whether I prefer Google Photos or Apple for memories editing and so on  They are pretty closely matched for me Not sure I like the iOS18 photos app yet to be honest so Google Photos probably gets the nod here at the moment but its very close  Both are some of the best software that Google and Apple have to offerGemini live isnt there yet  The DEI and  preaching crap it keeps bringing up is really annoying I dont need my phone to remind me that all people are equal or women should be respected every time I ask for a fact about employment figures thanks Google  It also needs to be able to talk to normal Gemini to create links show photos play music and so on And do it when the phone is still locked GoogleCall screening  I havent used it yet but presuming it works its a great featureThe reading mode in Safari is something I mentioned that I love for the iPhone  Google has a free download called Reader mode and you can set it up to activate using a two finger swipe up from bottom of screen  this is actually better than iOS in some ways because it works in the news reader and loads of other apps too It doesnt include images though which the Apple Safari one does This doesnt come preinstalled thoughRecorder app with summary and text translation is a great featureSplit screen although it is a bit flaky on Android 14  Reddit always crashes using it for example  Maybe they will fix it for Android 15 or remove itHold for me Amazing if it works again I havent used it yet thoughDirect my call as aboveNotification history is a nice touch  being able to look back at all my notifications if I accidentally deleted one NiceGemini feature ask about this screen  option appears if this is available on the screen and you can ask questions about it Works quite wellSelecting text via the app switcher is niceGoogle news  you can block any providers you dont like completely Apple news leaves a big sign there saying you have blocked this news provider  click here to unblock which is a big screw you from Apple as far as I can seeGoogle lens although this is coming in iOS is quite cool tooMagic eraser is really good for removing things from photos works far better than I thought possible Again it is coming to iOS in the coming months  I used the beta though and it was poorNow a couple of observations about smart watchesApple watch Ultra has better battery life but the PW3 will still happily get you through 24 hours including sleep tracking working out and listening to musicSleep tracking seems more accurate on my Pixel Watch 3 my AW seems to badly underestimate deep sleepExercise stuff seems pretty similar although I should note that on my Ultra my HR monitor always disconnects corrupting my data  Very annoying  Note that all my normal AW did not do this and were fineIt is much easier and better to get new watch faces on the Pixel Watch On AW this is really flaky and annoying if you arent using the standard facesUltra is far tougher than the pixel Watch Im still nervous about scratching my PW3I personally prefer the strap system of the Apple watch Still waiting for my pixel buds pro 2s so no comparison there yetWell I hope anybody looking to move between Pixel and Apple finds some of this useful  Im sure I will get plenty of posts with solutions for Pixel that are like iPhone features If so thanks  And remember these are just my observations and opinions","325":"Got the Pixel Watch 3 four months ago after getting tired of my Garmin watch garbage

the line Note and SUltra phones I finally gave the Pixel phones a chance and gotta say aside from a some Samsung customization perks and the Spen I dont really miss anything Major drive for the switch

print heating up these are the ones that come to mindBut the main reason I am thinking of switching to Samsung is that the S24U is an amazing phone almost perfect it it had stock androidWhat do you guys thinkEDIT Added fingerprint reader to issues with pixel I just wish they bring back the back fingerprint reader ","332":"Long time NexusPixel user Ive never really used Bluetooth devices much until the last few years when I got the OG Pixel buds and then later on the Pixel watch Other than that its usually only for Android AutoAnd ever since Ive been struggling to understand the logic with some of the Bluetooth device behavior when using them with Pixel phones1 When making a call with any Bluetooth device connected It always switches to that device when the other person answers the phoneFor example Ill be making a call with my phone connected to a Bluetooth speaker or Android Auto But I want to use the built in phone ear speaker instead for privacy or whatever So while the phone is ringing I switch to the phone ear speaker but as soon as the other person picks up it would switch back to the Bluetooth deviceThis is completely unrelated to any safety feature for Android Auto which was my initial thought when I didnt have any Bluetooth accessories It happens with my Sony ear buds my Pixel watch my gaming headphones etcIf I switch to a different speaker while making a call I expect it to remain until the call is overIts gotten to the point of me disabling the Pixel watch as a Bluetooth speaker because it makes it worse even when I dont have any other Bluetooth devices connected2 Why do I need 4 actions to disconnect from a device Sometimes more when the phone is locked We need a simple toggle next to all the connected devices in the quick tile menu instead of the gear icon that takes us to the Bluetooth settings pageMy phone is rooted but I cant seem to find any mods to help with these other than flashing a different romIts been a few years now and for simple bugs google sure is taking its sweet time to fix it If anything it seems to be getting worse","333":"","334":"Pixel 9 Pro XL my main phone second Pixel as I had the Pixel 7 Pro which I upgraded from

fix it the only likely solution is to pay for Google to repair it which will cost almost the same as the phone cost when it was brand newIve been a big fan I liked the battery life and smooth gaming experience I even got Pixel buds and just last month a Pixel Watch 2This was a huge burn and I cant decide if I want to try again with another Pixel or if I should look for something else Am I just unlucky or is there another recommended brand you think I should go for Budget isnt top range I wouldnt be looking for the latest model of anything One or two iterations ago like the 7 was would suit me best I live in Japan but Im not expecting countryspecific advice","336":"After switching fully from an iPhone 12 to a Pixel 9 I leaned in hard on the switch and got the Pixel Buds Pro 2 The quality of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in both sound and usability is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the Airpod Pros 2 Im no tech guru but as an average consumer who listens to music while doing admin work in the office or while running outdoors the sound quality on these things Pixel Buds Pro 2 is magnificent The bass quality had me dancing almost right away And the noise cancellation works SO wellAs far as usability is concerned it always drove me nuts on the Airpod Pros 2 whenever Id need to switch songs while I was out for a run I hated having to squeeze both sides of an airpod multiple times just to change a song go back or pause Perhaps its just me or the shape of my ears but whenever I would squeeze the airpod Id have to quickly readjust the airpod in my ear The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are so simple to use a quick tap on the outside of the bud does the job Accessing Google Assistant or enabling Noise Cancellation feels so easy to doAlso I love that there are color variations to choose from on the Pixel buds This may not be important for everyone but it is to meIt was worth every penny switching over to the Pixel Buds Pro 2 from the Airpod Pros 2 If both the Pixel Buds and Airpods worked well on iPhones Id still always choose the Pixel Buds not that I ever plan to go back to an iPhone after the P9 I hope you liked my review Have a great day","337":"I dont know how a tech company like

absolutely ridiculous experienceI ordered the Pixel 9 XL on black friday including the free Pixel buds that come with a new pixel order I received an email requesting ID verification which I submitted immediately The next day my order still hadnt gone through I was concerned so I called customer support waited 2 hours twice and was disconnected both times I eventually got through and was reassured that ID review takes 24 hours not to worry it would be fineA few hours later my order was entirely cancelledThen I messaged customer support ref17331818419107798 with my concern At first I got the message do not worry Ill recreate the order itll be totally fine Only for the charge to be 230 higher than it should be customer support was attempting to charge me for the buds I caught this then customer support realized the mistake and pivoted to go to the physical store with your cancelled order theyll be able to honor the promotionorder I asked specifically if it would be an online order issue the feedback I got was No that will not be an issueSo I go to the store the next day Only to be told it was an online order only and they cannot honor it but not to worry Order the phone today call the customer loyalty department and they can honor the promotionSo the next day I call customer loyalty dept they say it is an online only promotion and they cant do anything about it The only thing they can do is point me aaaaaaaall the way back to online orderchat and see if they can do anything about it Ive gone full circle wasted 6 hours of my life and will probably just cancel my ATT

iphone and refuses to use android again after the Samsung S22 and pixel 4 years We got two little children baby and one 5 year oldI heavily used iphones still have an iphone 15 pro max 512gb but

to be more advanced and do more things than the iphone even in prior pixel years The hardware SUCKED compared to iphones in the past Now the pixel hardware is superb and the softwareAI features are an awesome start for our world into AI In other words I got bored of the iphone and switched to pixel which makes me more excited to use daily Would I switch back to iphone full time use one day Sure maybe But for now I got the best of both worlds as my iphone as my secondary phone and my pixel as my main phone I cant connect my phones to work stuff because of work policies but its ok iMessage I

of 22nd August I have ordered the 6 Pro 7 Pro 8 Pro Buds Tablet etc all before with no issues When I received the delivery box it already had some damage to it Therefore I immediately took photos of the entire unboxing process and lo and behold the phone was not in the actual phone box and instead there had been additional tissue paper stuffed inside to fill the spaceI immediately went to Google support and have been battling with them over 3 weeks with over 20 emails sent from my end with very little response from them They are refusing to help and are basically claiming that DPD tracking shows the package is delivered which means the phone must be in there When I contact DPD they said their contract is with Google so any missing items I need to raise with Google and theyll have to rectifycorrectGoogle Store support both via email or telephone support is zero help and I am really feeling helpless now as its nearing 3 weeks and theyve ignored my past 4 emails sent to them over

everyone I got my Pixel 8 back in October 2024 and I live in India where temperatures are hitting 35C 95F and beyond Lately my phone feels warm sometimes even hotI mostly use it for watching content on YouTube Prime Video or Netflix usually with my Pixel Buds Series A Im always on WiFi but switch to mobile data occasionally for better receptionGiven the heat and my usage what can I do to keep my phone at a decent temperature Any tips or settings I should tweak","352":"I preordered my Buds 2 Pro on Sept 1 and they arrived today Sydney Australia Early impressions and comparions with Sony WF1000XM4 below Note that I bought then immediately sent back the original Pixel Buds Pro when they were first released in favour of keeping the XM4s As others have said theyre very small and light Fit feels good Im not sure I have the right sized tips in yet Im just using the mediums so far but they definitely feel secure They dont move at all when I shake my head around The real test though is sweat Ill wear them on my walk tomorrow hopefully to test if the seal breaks continually Thats the usual problem I have with buds I pretty much solved it with Comply tips on the XM4s Oh and I tested eating with them in and they didnt move YMMV but great for me I could sleep in these but I have pretty big ears so they dont stick out on me  Slept in them last night All playback controls work every time play pause skip etc I REALLY like that the confirmation beep on skip track is slightly delayed On the XM4s its immediate and I often dont hear it because all I can hear is my tap This is compounded by the fact that the XM4s controls are much harder to hit cleanly so I often end up pausing single tap when Im trying to skip double tap Volume swipe works every time Tap and hold for assistant works every time Assistant is fast and helpful I believe its using my phones chosen assistant I prefer Google Assistant to Gemini still Slight issue the assistants voice MAY be a little too loud for my liking I havent tried reducing it yet and Im not sure I want to because itll probably be a good volume when Im most likely to use it while walking Sound quality is very good Hard to say if its better than the XM4s because I have both EQd But I like the PBP2 setup better than the setup Ive got going on the XM4 at the moment Its all a lot cleaner but still very prominent and clean bass The XM4s sound muddy by comparison I may be able to close that gap by adjusting my EQ but havent tried yet and probably wont Theyre not a patch on my 50 IEMs for sound quality but thats to be expected Eartip seal check didnt work Said there was too much noise even though I was sitting completely still in a quiet room Hearing wellness feature is cool I often worry I have the volume too high but it says Im OK  Thats at about 80dB Conversation detection isnt working out of the box Ive looked hard and theres no setting for it I Googled it and can see that other people have experienced this problem One guy said it magically appeared after a few hours so Ill keep checking back Apparently my firmware is up to date so Ill just have to wait  Yep the toggle setting just appeared after a few hours Weird And yep its good Kicks in in about 12 seconds Love the case Its better than the Pixel Buds A case and definitely better than the XM4 case With the XM4s I always seem to choose the wrong side to open the lid from It seems like a trivial thing I know but still Putting in and out of the case is easier than with the original Pixel Buds Pro Not yet easier than the XM4s but I suspect thats just a question of getting used to it  muscle memoryI cant think of anything else to mention but if you have any questions feel free to ask If I think of anything else later Ill edit my original postEDIT I believe ANC is significantly better than the original Buds Pro from memory They were nowhere near as good as the XM4s The Buds Pro 2 are actually better than the XM4s However its important to note that I have different tips on the XM4s now Back when I compared them to the original Pixel Buds Pro I was using the stock tips probably medium Im now using Comply tips size small So its possible the seal isnt quite as good The seal still FEELS as good and the bass is as good as I remember it being back then so I dont think theres a seal issue but you never know The box with the tips in it is very good Makes it easy to keep them separated My right ear is hurting a bit but I think thats because I tried the small tip in that ear for a while and I think they were jammed in further or a hard surface was pushing on my ear where it wasnt with the medium Ive switched back to the medium and will report back on this later Call quality is good I just had a 25 min phone call with my boss and he said he could hear me clearly He said it sounded like I was a bit further from the mic but also that that may be because he was outside a loud restaurant in the wind ie It may have been a problem at his end Ill report back on this too I cant get Gemini Live to work properly I can invoke it with the magic words but it cant seem to hear me after that I can use Google Assistant by pressing and holding my right bud though and thats fine for me Gemini will cost money after the first year  Actually I think this may be my own stupid fault I have a1 month free trial but I havent activated it so I suspect thats why its not working Im not interested in paying 30 per month for AI so I doubt Ill try it No sound leakage At least according to my wife Im listening at 80db lying next to her in bed and she said she cant hear it at allIm very interested to see how well it cancels wind noise when listening to media The XM4s do a good job of thatSUMMARY AFTER SEVERAL HOURS USE Theyre very good Ill be keeping them and will probably sell the XM4s Biggest reasons comfort fit touch controls case removing from case One word convenience So far theyre exactly what I need from a pair of buds like this Very good allrounders and everything is easy I wouldnt buy them for DEDICATED music listening ie sitting and listening with eyes closed but for listening while DOING theyre great Since buying IEMs I dont think Id ever buy TWS buds for dedicated listening although Ive not tried anything 500 but I suspect Ill end up listening to more music on these and more of each song simply because I can easily and comfortably listen while doing other stuff I havent had a chance to exercise in them yet but Im betting thatll be fineEDIT  I went for a good walk with these in this morning 1hr 40min of hard walking Sweated quite a bit Spent about 13 of the walk listening to an audiobook and about 23 on the phone They felt secure the whole time and pretty comfortable A slight discomfort but nothing terrible I didnt feel driven to adjust the fit the whole time When I did twist and push when I got home though the right one had lost its seal Also I noticed a rustling sound with every step I believe this was slight movement of the tips It wasnt a showstopper but its not something I hear with my XM4s and the Comply buds Ive now switched to a pair of Spinfit CP155 tips so see how they go Just sitting they feel a little more seated but I wont know for sure until I go for a walk tomorrow morning Ill report back then My phone call recipient was my boss and I talk to him a lot on my walks He said there was less wind noise on these than normal It felt nicerefreshing to not have the huge XM4s in my ears Not that the big body of those buds makes them uncomfortable for me but you still know theyre there eg You cant feel the movement of air on that part of your outer ear ANC wind noise management touch controls all worked fineEDIT The Spinfits are no good The buds dont charge in the case with them on and they made the same rustling noise I tried a pair of Symbio tips which are a hybrid with silicone outer and foam inner and they fit the buds fine didnt stop them charging although they seem to impede the magnet a little when dropping the buds into the case and they dont adversely affect the bass They also seem not to make the rustling noise as much But they reduced the effectiveness of the ANC so for now Ive switched back to the stock tipsFINAL EDITIve decided to send them back After wearing them for several hours today I began to find them fairly painful in my left ear Bummer Have ordered a pair of Sony Linkbuds S instead","353":"Hi allSo my pair arrived this morning and I already have a few thoughts on them  Please bear in mind these are just my opinions and Im not a pro reviewer or anythingFirstly wow these are so small and light  They make my airpod pro 2s feel big  They are really comfy to wear too Setting up on my Pixel was a doddle and there was an update already to the software to 2117 for buds and 155 for caseThe sound on them for me is excellent and I like them as much as my Airpod Pro 2s  I havent played with the EQ and probably wont to be honest because songs are recorded at so many different levels youll be constantly fiddling with it so I just leave it as is  Im also over fifty now so my hearing isnt top notchThe noise cancelling is excellent and I would say as good as my Airpod Pro 2s as well so far All of it feels really nicely made the earphones snap into the case nicely and I look forward to seeing what the battery life is likeNow for the problemsNow this is the first pair of Pixel Buds I have owned but the touch stuff is seriously problematic under certain situations for me so far  I took the dog out for a walk to test them and everything was great initially but then it started raining and suddenly everything went to shit  Even though we were quite dry in a wood sheltering my fingers became damp and the earphones stopped responding  The music just stopped and the only way to get it to play again was using my phoneThen when I put my hood up and starting jogging back the hood must have kept brushing the tips and starting and stopping the music and putting the noise cancelling on and off  Very annoying Especially in the rain with a dogAnyway once this happened it was like the earphones crashed  Putting them back in the case then taking them out again got them working properly again  So I dont know if this is a software glitch or not but Im not going back out into the rain too test then againAnother thing is knowing where to tap them  You cant see the side of your head so you when you go to pause them for instance you tend to be putting the volume up and down and jumping forwards and backwards a track  Im going to give them a while but this is really annoying for me at the moment  Airpods just work so much better in this regardAnyway these are just my initial thoughts after a few hours  Perhaps after some use Ill get better accustomed to the pads and how to use them  I hope so because theyre lovely and sound and cancelling are greatEDIT Forgot to mention the Gemini integration is working really well so far in the limited use I have made for itEDIT2 multipoint connection works really really well for meEDIT3 after saying all that about the multi point its stopped working  Nothing will play on my Pixel now  I had to put the buds back in the box shut down all my media apps shut my MacBook and reopen media apps on my Pixel to get it to work  Poor  Hopefully sorted with an update sometime in the future Sigh ","354":"Anyone else experience this Recently my pixel buds pro 2 have started to pause after skipping If I double tap it skips ahead 10 seconds and plays a second of audio

it was out of their scope So I send it to Google and they say there are no issues great So they send it back and obviously the same issues happen againNow I am in the process of sending it back for a replacement and they are sending me a refurbished phone and not a new one so I spent 600 on a refurbished phone essentially I dont care if its refurbished but should I not get some compensation for their faulty device not working Instead I am punished for their mistake I really wouldnt mind if I just got some compensation even like 100 google store credit or something to get some ear budsI have

reflections decrease treble boost 3kHz 15dB and increase bass a few dB  Wouldnt you know it that sounds exactly like Pixel 8s speaker frequency response  GeniusIt naturally has the inverse of these effects meaning it should produce the objectively correct sound indoors  Pixel buds A as well have perfect frequency responses for the original Harman target curve which is also based on these same effects but adjusted to account for the effects of puting the speaker right up to your ear in a head phone This means the speakers on Pixel 8 indoors and Pixel Buds A series should sound the same

features I love with Samsung and this may be available on pixel as well is the ability to snap 2 apps on the screen at the same time half and half so I can game on one and check reddit on the other etcI have some hearing loss so the ability to set up headphones based on the hearing test is excellent is this available on pixel The battery life doesnt bother me as Samsung flip so bad with this I know it will be an improvement as will the screen The pixel buds look excellent is another reason Im changing and I do like the ai features as well Am I right in thinking to vocal minority are the loudest to complain here Or are all the issues relevant I should consider my choices of a new phone this yearEDIT Thanks fir everyones responses its been very helpful and us appreciated

 GermanyHello everyone I am planning on buying a phone and using it for about 5 years  I currently have a Motorola Edge 20 Lite and honestly the battery performance drop is just insane Apart from that I love Motorola phones I am a close to graduating and with education discount I am getting Pixel 9 pro128 GB for 790 and Pixel 9128 GB for 700 with free Pixel buds with both of them Nothing Phone is quite different from and cheaper than Pixel 9 series I honestly dont like the glyphs and find it quite distracting However I do think the phone as a whole is value for money So nothing phone 3a pro would be at about 450 and I would save some money My question is  given longevity being the main concern  should I go for Pixel or Nothing phones Are there any other phones that I should consider

pixel 9 pro XL I would like nice call quality I use my earbuds throughout the whole day typically Fit is important as I wouldnt want them falling out throughout my work day but I know fit is subjective and dependent on the person Im by no means an audiophile The case is always in my pocket as well Right now both are on sale Pixel buds are 179 and the Technics are 199 Trying to stay at the

httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomtombluetoothDevicesWidgethlenUSpli1httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomtombluetoothDevicesWidgethlenUSpli1which either I couldnt figure out how to work or also does nothingThe only workaround Ive found is to manually make any and all devices forget ever being connected to the device That means the following1 Once I leave the car make my phone forget the car steps belowBluetooth  Under saved devices  Car gear icon  Forget trash icon2 Turning OFF Bluetooth on my personal laptop once used3 Forgetting my device after using it any other deviceBluetooth  Under saved devices  Pixel Budsgear icon  Forget trash iconThis should not be this hard nor confusing Given the amount of people using bluetooth I figure there must be a solution to this My assumption is that once a device is turned on it broadcasts a way saying Im available My devices will immediately say got it switching over now I want it to ignore that wave at all times Does anyone know how to fix this issueEDITThank you to uSpiderStratagem for the following solution Ive written a write up on my experience below and in my comment to them as wellThe following DOES WORK to prevent the PHONE

2024 I switched from the pixel 7 pro to the S24 ultra mainly due to having a job that I was doing outside most of the time and anyone who is even a little bit techy knows was an issue with the pixel phones and Tensor up until the 9 series So rather than wait and potentially cause harm to my device with it overheating by just using it normally and the fact my phone was almost dead by 5pm most days I moved back to Samsung with the S24 ultra I then exchanged my Pixel watch 2 for a Galaxy watch 7 since Samsung was offering a huge trade in benefit for my ancient Galaxy watch 3 and I only paid like 100 for it and then gave my pixel watch 2 to my dad Fast forward to today I have a Galaxy book 5 pro 14 inch as well I just got to replace my Asus gaming laptop I almost never actually play games on

but hey it was early 2021 Google only sold these and there was no announcement of new earbuds from them reviews werent TOO bad so I went for itAnd oh boy was it the worst experience Ive ever had from start to finishIt started with having to replace them for literally 4 times as they always kept disconnecting from my phone and didnt want to reconnect until kept in the case for 510 minutes Also every single one of them always had some degree of case defect as the lid didnt align to the rest of the case making an awful sound when closing Hey at least the last pair of earbuds seemed decent enough on this regard and only disconnected once every 1020 days it wasnt too bad after all Well unfortunately issues didnt end there Because of course how did I not think that they could have disparity issues Like they constantly and consistently dispaired making the left earbud play sound first and then came the right one And the only way to fix this was to stop any audio coming from them wait for a couple of seconds and then play again Oh also did I mention that they have ALWAYS had a kind of background noise when anything was playing It was horrible silence apparently cannot exist with them Pixel Buds Anyways issues persisted all the time Ive owned them and recently new ones started appearing such as the right earbud only lasting literally A QUARTER of the time the left one does Well this of course only happens when Im just listening to anything because when Im in a call they only last 1520 minutes And last but not least some of these buds sometimes think theyre charging when theyre actually not and sometimes they think the case is open while its actually notBefore anyone says anything yes Ive contacted multiple times Google support even with Google One and they always had the same troubleshooting process charge them and factory reset them Needless to say this didnt work everAnyways yes this looks like a rant and it probably is These Pixel Buds are the reason I will never again buy any more buds from Google they have absolutely awful support and theyre terrible on every aspect Ive also never owned any other wireless earbuds before so I cant even say theyre terrible compared to X No theyre terrible period All this for an even more awful price tag of 200  Thats disgusting And no Im not trying to boycott Google I own a Pixel phone and a Pixel Watch and theyre great Great price not so much for the watch but if we compare it to Apples and great functionalities But come on is this really all they can do with some earbudsI hope they fixed these issues on their newer buds but in the meantime I hope to have warned any potential Pixel Buds buyer You might have a terrible experience Thanks for reading","409":"Hey all Im having a weird issue with my new Pixel Buds Pro 2 This seems to only happen on my Pixel 9 Pro XL and combined with YouTube Music however I think the latter is only cause it plays louder than other apps Ive tested When listening to some music at max volume the sound will go like underwater for a few seconds before returning to normal I can reproduce this every time at the exact same point in the exact same song at max volume  If I pair my airpods to the Pixel this doesnt happen at all testing with the same songs in Youtube Music Equally if I pair my Pixel Buds with my Mac or Windows PC and play the same song at max volume it also doesnt happen Also Ive tried the normal YouTube app and the Android Apple Music app with the same songs and this doesnt happen either however Ive noticed that they sound slightly quieter than YouTube Music on the Pixel This also doesnt happen if I turn the volume down a bit with YouTube MusicI havent modified anything to do with volume its all as default Ive also noticed that if I turn off ANC this does not happen on YouTube Music either It seems to be purely YouTube Music on the Pixel at max volume with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 but Im thinking Youtube Music isnt the issue it just seems to play louder than any other source which is causing the issue Has anyone else had this issue","410":"My friends phonepixel 6 pro brings this whenever its turning on after shutting down How can it be fixed","411":"Add me to the me too list for Pixel 9 Qi issues I know the articles floating around are focusing on the Pro XL but my nonPro Pixel 9 seems to have the issue as well1 Ive tried a few Magsafe charges with two different cases and none of them work They all show charging for about 10 seconds then show no charging Very reliably2 Ive grabbed a couple nonmagsafe Qi chargers that I bought from the Google Store the Pixel Stand 1 and the iottie dock has a second Qi charger for ear buds Neither of these will charge with any case on They both charge successfully with no case on the phoneIll be getting a Fold and a miniPro in next week Ill do more testing with those phones once theyre here I hope this is something Google can fix with a software update This is disappointingOn a side note In the process I created this overlay to figure out where the Qi coil is relative to the G Theyre pretty well aligned with each otherhttpsimgurcomgallerypixel9nonproqicoilalignmentHU6xDj7httpsimgurcomgallerypixel9nonproqicoilalignmentHU6xDj7","412":"I wanted to move away from Apple I have all the Apple things and after being with them for years I decided to wholesale move over to Google I liked what they offered with the Fold and the ecosystem around itI ordered a Pixel Fold and a new pair of Buds together The buds werent out yet but I was happy to wait a few weeksI also ordered the new Pixel Watch as a separate order and I ordered a set of bathroom scales Googles Fitbit Aria scalesSo heres the issuesThe phone arrived and its great no complaints however the courier ended up losing the scales Looking at the tracking it looks like they got to my local depot and got lost there I spoke to the courier via their app DPD and they confirmed the items are missing and I should go back to the sender Google I took screenshots of Googles DPD tracking info showing the item was tracked up until my local depot but shows as being held there I took a screenshot of my chat with DPD I put all this together and started a Google Support chat session The advisor said they would have to escalate it and get back to me A few days later I received an email from Google Support saying they can confirm the was delivered to my address I honestly couldnt believe what they were saying here I was shocked I had proof from several sources saying the item was missing Googles own courier claims its missing But Google repeatedly claimed the item was delivered and refused to back up their claim with any proof They closed the caseI stressed this again to Google laying it all out 1 more time with all the screenshots again I said I want a Final Response position from Google here so I can decide if I am going to put together a small claims court Google response that the item has been delivered and this is their final response So I send off a letter to their HQ in London saying outlining everything again and suggesting I will take them to small claims court should they not refund meBut alas there is much moreBy this time I am getting quite frustrated but also wondering where my Pixel Buds are remember I ordered them together with the phone I arranged a finance agreement with Klarna for this so it was all 1 amount but they should be due to arrive any time nowI check the order status and Google had cancelled the Pixel Buds from my original order with no warning prior no notification afterwards or anything I again start a chat session with Google Support and they say that yes they cancelled them I ask why and they claim Because of terms of service I didnt know what this meant so I ask again and they claim that they dont have to give me a reason that they can cancel any part of my order at any time for any reason They suggest that if I want to order some more Pixel Buds then thats my choiceI check with Klarna and they have the full finance agreement in place for both items So I go back and explain that the order was for 2 items but they are not interested at all Now at this point I could probably go back to Klarna let them open an investigation and ultimately after their customary 21 days investigation lead time have the finance agreement amended to not include the Pixel Buds Then I could reorder them again from Google under a fresh finance agreement and another credit check But by now I am pretty pissed off I no longer want to have anything to do with Google and certainly dont want to order more products from themI wanted to make the argument that Google in this instance is in breach of contract My contract with them was for the phone and the buds This was 1 order with 1 order number containing 2 items Google has failed to meet the obligations of this contract and now I want the finance deal cancelled and I can make arrangements to return the phone which at this point was 4 days outside the 14 day refund policy  to me this doesnt matter as they broke the contractTo me having the Buds are an essential component to the order I realise the are a much cheaper part of the total order but it was essential that along with the phone I also got the Buds The way Google sells the integrations between the phone and buds was a key reason for me ordering them togetherI put all this together in an email after speaking to Trading Standards and I basically got a 1 line response along the line of After careful review noSo yet again Ive had to go through the process of a Final Response  answer no And now I am at the state of asking if they are part of an Alternative Dispute Resolution scheme to look at this case Failing that again I will have to open another small claims court caseAnd finally at this point I dont want any Google products I wanted to return my Google Pixel watch which was inside the 14 days so I could click the return button on the website However I cant do this as as soon as I click the refund button I get an error on the page saying I need to contact support I speak to chat yet again and yet again they say they need to escalate the issue 3rd time for 3 cases and I just dont hear back from them after daysTo make matters worse Google refuses to give me any case numbers during the email conversations and they insist that all these separate issues are dealt with via 1 long email chain with the different issues and their replies all mingled togetherThis is the worst experience I have ever had with a company Its just diabolical and they should be ashamed of their behaviorPlease guys dont buy anything from Google again","413":"My

pro There were so many tiny things that made my life easier on my Huawei that for some reason just arent as intuitive on the pixel 9 pro Eg screenshots  I used to take them and my Huawei would let me edit and send them immediately but Ive got to click extra steps on my pixel pro And because the Huaweis screen was quite big you could just swipe along the bottom menu buttons and it would give you a smaller display until you dismissed it which was easy to do onehanded On this phone though you have to be using gestures in order to have the option of making the display smaller but I dont want gestures on I want the menu bar at the bottom There are other things that I cant think of right now but because I used both of those features regularly on my old phone and therefore tried to use them on this new phone I just thought theyd be better Ive never missed an old phones functionality before because usually they improve even across brands But sometimes I feel like the pixel pro is a bit clunky Plus Im having trouble with the earbuds and Ive emailed them twice about it and no one has contacted me which Im really annoyed about","416":"Anyone use AirPods with Pixel phones Work ok I know you wont get all Apple features on an Android but what is missing and do they work fineIm thinking as Ive had AirPods in past and prefer them to buds that shove inside ear I prefer the AirPod type

shove in ear type ","417":"Well I dont think Ill be buying the pro model anymore The first ones were bad then I got the 2022 pros because of a discount They lasted over a year but I cant get a

experiences to mix things up This is NOT me minimizing those anecdotes or claiming anyone who has had issues is lying I am merely doing this to verify the concept of silicon lotteryPreOrdered the Pixel 8 Pro through my carrier it was 600 OFF before tradein and I effectively got it for about 150 after handing in my Pixel 7 In the first month or so I dumbassedly started tinkering w it before paying it off and ended up bricking it trying to install a Beta build Google warranty replaced it no questions asked in about a 3day turnaroundSince late October Ive been using the Unlocked replacement 8 Pro from Google alongside the Pixel Watch 2 and Pixel Buds Pro and I want for virtually nothing Having compared it to the Galaxy S24 and iPhone 15 Pro I find the way Pixel hardware marriages together to be just as fluid if not more so in certain areas than Apple Ive tried my hand at AirPods and an iPad I largely prefer the way Pixel plays nicely with my Tab S9 Ultra S Pen brings everything together Samsung is probably the most logical alternative for Android users at the moment I found the Galaxy a breeze to use but missing Pixel exclusivesAll in all silicon lottery My replacement was mandatory as the software bricking compromised the initial model so this isnt even technically the launch Pixel but it was a brand new model they sent and not refurbished so I consider it part of the launch batch Even while tinkering I have had zero heating issues lag or general bugs I can think of Kind of strangeJust putting here in case anyone is thinking of the Pixel ecosystem It works and it works damn well I enjoy seeing Google answer the efficiency concerns with each passing iteration I do still think they could do more as a trilliondollar company to speed things up but Im also not a giant tech conglomerate On mine and many others in my friendfamily circles end Pixel comes highly recommended here","421":"My Pixel Buds Pro 2 just a few months old were working fine but

ever since I bought it I have a pair of Samsung galaxy bud 2 pros and a pair of Sony xm3s It was usually fine with the xm3s but the buds 2 pros would always have static when taking a call and coming back to regularly playing audio I eventually got sick of the issue and went online looking for a fix and somebody told me to change the map value in the Bluetooth audio settings in developer settings I changed it from 12 to 14 I tried to reset all my settings and pair everything the same and I found other issues which were mitigated by changing something with disabling Bluetooth le hardware offload but this left my headphones not sounding very good So I set it back to 12 and ever since all Bluetooth problems have been resolved it never cuts out anymore It connects faster than ever and doesnt have issues when switching between phone calls and media I was so close to sending this phone back I like everything else about it but this issue was a deal breaker for me luckily its now fixed

Pixel Communityjust wanted to know from you guys and girls what do you think could come to the Pixel EcosystemHope we can have a good Discussion what Google maybe develop in the future1 If i remember correctly 2 years ago everyone thought we get the Pixel Dot or GSpot Airtag alternativ But still no sign if we get this or not Moto Tag is now here but still not as good as Airtags and Samsung Smarttags are only good with Samsung phones so what do you think2 After the Pixel buds pro 2 were a really good upgrade over older Pixel Buds do you guys think Google will release more Music  Audio products maybe something like Airpods 4 Earbuds without eartips but with ANC Also an Option would be something like the Nothing Ear Open or Shokz Open fit Air Open Ear buds Design or even with Eartips like from 1more S50 If we get the Pixel Buds pro 3 in 23 years i myself hope they add changeable Wingtips like the Soundcore Liberty 3 pro had3 Just an addition to Audio Products What do you think about Over ear headphones or bluetooth speakers also for outdoor usage like JBL does4 How will Chromebooks develop in the future Will they be more like Laptops or more like Tablets Will Chrome OS Stay and will become better or will it integrate Android more and more and maybe Chrome OS will become Android OS or something comepletly new5 Will we get a new generation of the Pixel Tablet Really would like to see Pixel Tablet Gen 2 with a better and cheaper Docking Station and maybe 2 Versions of the Tablet An 8 and an 11 Version I really would like to have a new tablet at home small 86 New Nest

as often as I want I have tried alot of android brands OnePlus Samsung Moto previous Pixel phones Each time I found myself switching back to the iPhone due to various reasons including app

phone Camera quality is seriously amazing Friends and family will literally ask me to take pictures for them after seeing pictures Ive previously taken  Problems Ive had with previous generations of Pixel phones have been directly addressed including cell reception problems audio sounding tinny fingerprint scanner being slow  The AI features have been tossed around as gimmicky but I genuinely use them so much For instance Ive been wanting to try more foods so Ill literally ask Gemini to create me a spicy Indian dish with chicken and add all ingredients to my list along with instructions on how to cook and itll do it effortlessly Using the AI Live feature as job interview prep has been amazing Itll ask me questions and rate my responses I actually used Add me on a family trip this weekend and it worked effortlessly App optimization seems to have improved I use Snapchat and Instagram stories alot and the camera is great on there as well Although iphone is definitely better Although not directly related to Google RCS becoming more mainstream has made messaging iPhone users significantly better  If youre on the fence on switching  Id suggest on doing so I have a feeling youre worried about missing iMessage FaceTime and the camera quality But the new additions have not made me thing about this once  Ive had this phone for a month and have loved every bit  I actually went full send

clipdistort making music and podcasts unlistenable The only way to fix it is to either wait it out or restart the phoneAt first it seemed random and sometimes still is but I seemed to have tracked down what triggers it to the power buttonFor example if Im listening to something and the buds are working normally if I press the power button to look at my notifications the audio will start to distort Then if I close the screen wait a beat and press the power button again this can sometimes fix the issue and the audio goes back to normal Its not every time but it does seem like the two are connected It also feels like sometimes when a notification comes in this can trigger the audio to distort This is regardless if the phone is on silent or notIve tried unpairing the buds turning offon Bluetooth  neither of which work I dont currently have access to another pair of Bluetooth headphones so cant test if this is unique to my Pixel BudsPhone and buds are both on the latest firmware

even louder to the point where I it hurts and I think it might be harmful to my earsThere are usually two places I notice this and rush to turn off transparency mode in the subway when a metro approaches  on the street when an emergency vehicle passes with sirensIt feels like transparency mode just blindly amplifies everything and ignores the volume limit You could almost say it works a bit too wellPersonally I prefer using transparency mode in public so I properly notice everything happening around me but this makes it annoying to useHas anyone else noticed this I was surprised at first

had an issue with it In December I lost one of my Pixel Pro Buds 2 earbuds and got a new set to replace Since then my microphoneinput audio will not pick up from my earbuds but only from my device Obviously this isnt ideal because the idea is for me to be able to use my buds hands free and I have to hold my phone currently to ensure audio quality I scoured the Internet for troubleshooting ideas and tried them all I ended up connecting with Google support and they said my buds are defective and sent me a new pair I just received them and the microphone still will not pick up from the new buds So now Im wondering if the issue is my phone or a recent system updateThe earbuds microphone do not work when I make phone calls or record voice notes in any messaging app BUT I can toggle to the buds as a microphone option in the Recording app on my phone Has anyone had this issue Any tips to resolveI have tried everything from restarting my phone ensuring my device is updated uninstalling and reinstalling the pixel buds app clearing my Bluetooth cache factory resetting the earbuds ensuring the phone calls setting is toggled on for Bluetooth TLDR Two year old Pixel 7 suddenly wont pick up

I give Chromebook a chance lol","481":"Starting three days ago I started having a plugged ear feeling with the right earbud and now the ear tip seal check fails the right earbud no matter what I troubleshooted the issue by changing the ear tips and trying to adjust the fit to no avail Then I performed a factory reset on the buds and that made no difference either After some experimentation I noticed the plugged ear feeling is not as pronounced while noise canceling or Transparency is enabled but it is still there slightly I am now convinced the issue lies with the Active inear pressure relief feature in the right earbud The day I started having the issue I contacted Google Store support who were unable to help and referred me to the Pixel Buds Customer Care Team They said they would contact me by email It took about 30 hours to hear back from them yesterday and they asked for my full name shipping address and phone number I replied promptly with the information requested but I have not heard back from them as of now Hopefully I can get the right earbud or the whole set replaced quickly Its a shame because I really enjoyed them before this issue They were a big improvement over my old PBP in terms of ANC quality and comfort For now Im using my 2yearold PBP and I miss the PBP2 The pressure feeling in one ear is just too uncomfortable for me to use them ","482":"I rarely use my buds for phone calls or anything else speech related so I dont know when the issue started to happen exactly But around the time of the recent firmware update the microphones in my buds stopped working properly and are basically dead sometimes they work for a second but only transmit distorted audio I kinda suspect the update because all microphones in both buds are affected at the same time which seems like it would be less likely if it was a hardware issueIve tried them with different devices Pixel 8a Pixel 6a Win11 Laptop and the issue persists so its the buds not the phone Ive reset them twice but unfortunately that didnt change anythingHave any of you come across similar issues or have ideas of what I could doBtw Im in Austria not the US so my options for dealing with Google

the reasons of greater storage than my previously used iPhone 12 Mini which was just 64GB to P9P at 256 GB With better Camera and cleaner experience After my use of about a month I just dont feel what I used to feel with iPhone and iOS The apps feel better optimised for iOS the multitasking and app switching on iOS feels more smoth and better overall feel  The camera is amazing on P9P but the switching between camera in Video mode is just aweful for me with changes in color grading quality and temperature  As a normal and minimalist user I didnt game on any phone thus I didnt felt heating issue at allThe Pixel 9 Pro is amazing in itself and could be said as probably best in Android world   But my need for iOS and Apple Ecosystem with all my conditioning of it is pulling me back to itSo

somethingI have done a lot of testings on my own wearing both watches and here is my short conclusionThe PW3 ist so much better in many ways when it comes to health metricsThe PW3 picks up my heart rate so much faster i can not begin to explain in words how bad the GW6 is in comparison When i lay down and stand up fast my heart rate usually goes from 70 to 100110 real quick and then settles back down to 80 when i am standing or walkingThe PW3 immediately notices this and displays it correctly whereas the GW6 still shows 7080 then suddenly maybe it gets to 100 after like 30 seconds but even then sometimes it doesnt pick up these quick changes in HRThe GW6 OS feels slower and less polished compared to the PW3The battery on the GW6 goes from 100 to 36 whereas the PW3 still holds above 50 chargeThe GPS Accuracy for walks on the GW6 is completely inaccurate according to many walks i walk through buildings and suddenly teleport 10 meters leftright whereas the PW3 catches everything perfectlyAdditionally lets not even mention how superior google assistance is compared to bixby Overall i am very deep into the Samsung ecosystem tablet buds phone  and i love it but seeing that their wearables are just very inaccurate and they miss some important minor features such as a good morning briefing i really am thinking of switching completely to googlepixelHow do you guys feel about that Do you think Samsung will catch up or do they just not care about these mentioned points as much The first downfall began when they removed realtime HR measures from the App and replaced it with this inaccurate weird average","487":"I have a pair of pixel buds Aseries that I used for my phone and then work laptop with MS teams no problem  Just added them as a Bluetooth device and they work

been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles wont like these but I disagree The profile is flat and natural Things sound how theyre supposed to sound like a mostly true studio quality You can turn the bass up if you need more  ANC Noise cancellation is solid Its on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds my previous daily driver and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear  Transparency Mode  This is where they really shine Transparency mode is fantastic  it feels super natural almost like youre not wearing earbuds at all This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many Ive tried these are hands down the best  Multipoint Works seamlessly  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues  Case The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original which is a nice touch The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case  Mics Mic quality is very clear  Touch controls Basically no difference here Ive never had issues with the touch controls on previous generationsOverallThe Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the

had a map showing her where we just were and our path back home I assume I enabled some kind of device sharing and its a pretty cool feature but I was surprised to see it working seamlessly with her iPhone I have never connected it to her phone with Bluetooth or anything else so it took me by surprise It even let me find it by hitting the locate button I think Ive shared my location with my wife previously if that helps","502":"Hello  Im hoping someone can please help me before this issue drives me crazy Ive owned a pair of Pixel Buds Pros for over two years However about half the time they do not reconnect to my phone Oppo A78 when I remove them from the case and put them in my ears When this happens the Buds turn on but there is no chime sound to indicate a successful pairing and audio continues to play through my phone speakers If I wait eventually a connection is formed after about a minute or two \u00a0The only thing that seems to speed this up is manually disabling my phones Bluetooth and then reenabling it while I am waiting for the connection to form When I do this the Buds pair automatically and instantlyIt appears totally random whether or not the connection will be successful The only trend I have observed is that the pairing tends to work better when I am at home and worse when I am away from homeWhen I first got the Pixel Buds I had a different phone Motorola Moto G9 and thought it was a problem with the phone However after getting a new phone Oppo A78 in 2023 I continued to experience the same problem and deduced it must be the Pixel Buds I RMAd them with Google and received a brandnew pair To my horror the new Buds exhibit the exact same issueI use several other Bluetooth devices with my phone and dont have the same issue with any of themI have tested the Buds albeit not extensively on nonAndroid devices iOS Windows and I havent managed to replicate the issue so I think it is some sort of Android issueI have tried the

before Was there a recent update or something Any solutions I know my volume balance is right in the middle Its not biased to left or right","505":"Context Im at my friends place cracking some cold ones and my friend sees a notification on his iPhone 13 that says Pixel Buds Pro 2 found and then when he clicked on it he could see its location and to top it all off he could play the lost device chime from his iPhone Further context my pixel buds pro 2 case has been closed and in my jacket pocket across the room Even further context I as the owner of the pixel buds pro 2 cannot even connect to them while theyre closed to play the lost device chime So of course I have questions related to this 1 How and Why is this possible Because this is a major security issue  2 Is there any way to lock other phones out from seeing my devices live location 3 And this is the more brand damaging part of this Why can an iOS device have more control over my Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 than I do with my own pixel 9 pro I cannot even play the chime from my latest pixel 9 pro phone but my friends iPhone 13 canAnyways Id love to read any comments from anyone who knows how to increase the security of

longer battery life But Im not sure if it would fit my device I have a galaxy phone and a MacBook","514":"The Samsung Galaxy Buds have features only available when paired with a Galaxy phoneDo the new Pixel Buds Pro 2 have any features that are unique when paired with a Pixel phoneThanks ","515":"","516":"","517":"The right bud randomly loses bass and comes back after a few seconds For a week its been fine but now it will not stop all of my use as been on spotify with the issues before it worked fine and youtube and plex were perfect I tried changing settings but is there more settings I am unaware of like to control noise cancelation and stuff where is the main controls for the buds just the normal settings on the phone Again Loved these for this week I just got them but now I am having a low end drop off on the right bud off and on its very odd  thanks","518":"","519":"Just picked up a pair of pixel buds pro One of my primary reasons for my choice was the multipoint connection feature which it seems not a lot of earbuds haveOverall the buds are working well and I am impressed but a problem I am having relates to the multipoint connection The iPhone is a work phone my personal phone is an Android I listen to music and podcasts on my personal phone and I dont listen to anything on my work phone its pretty much only for texts and phone callsI need the multipoint feature so that I can still answer a call on the iPhone while I am listening to something on my android Whenever I put the buds in my ears however and try to listen to something it wont play the android just refuses to play anything I have to go to the iPhone and disconnect Bluetooth before the android will play audio which tells me that the buds are prioritizing the iPhone I dont see any setting that will allow me to alter this behavior","520":"Is anyone facing the issue that pixel buds Pro microphone quality is bad when the ceiling fan is on","521":"I got tired of Samsung and decided to switch for a pure Google  Android experience Also I got free Pixel Buds Pro 2 so it was nice I didnt use any Samsung specific app so It was extremely easy to changeSo Now that you have the backstory heres the things I dislike or miss1 A native music player like Samsung Music is missing but luckily I found a good music player that read all my 2000 songs2 A native photo  video gallery with decent features Google photos is great to store and search images but lacking my most used feature of Samsung Gallery  Press and hold anywhere on an image and it attempts to auto select what you pointed at and if selected properly you could save it as a new image or copy  share it directly3  The Pixel Camera app doesnt allow me to control exposure just by holding somewhere to focus and then lowering it like Apple or Samsung Camera app and I havent found a way to do itThats it I dont regret my change but of course Im a little sad for having these basic things missing Other than that its a great phone","522":"Spent about 3 hours getting everything dialed  so far so good","523":"I love a lot of things about the pixel but as a long time iOS user Im having mild buyers remorse  anxiety I have 8 days left to trade the phone back  Would love some reassurance from longerterm pixel users I will say some stuff I love so far is  Design the Hazel is stellar  Google makes everything easy its well explained and covers most of the bases youd have questions around from switching over  Google ecosystem works great for productivity  Pictures are fun to take and the quality is imo better for the casual enjoyer Customization but wont get into it as everyone knows this already  Google is putting in effort to be consumer friendly while apple recently has been trending opposite Cost to package ratio Some stuff Im having anxiety about  accessories are what I miss most about apple Really liked my Apple watch and airpods I have pixel buds now and they just dont hit how I hoped  unfortunately Im one of the users affected by scroll stutter and lag in many apps like Reddit FB YouTube and instagram makes me feel like the phone is less premium On android 15 Google photos just isnt as seamless as iCloud photos imo it syncs inconsistently for me switching between cameras is VERY choppy  app performance I feel as if the QAQC of 3rd party apps is not up to par with apple the difference between optimization of different apps is noticeable whereas on iOS they are all generally similar to where you dont feel much of a difference ","524":"For all the btching and complaining I did for my Pixel 8 Pro I need to give an updateDespite all the problems I experienced with my Pixel 8 Pro at the 6 month mark it now seems to be stable and working as it should I am getting pretty good battery life dont have to but I charge it usually 1 time during the day and at bedtime app response is good very few issues mostly surroundings certain appsSo I am happy with the phone Pixel Watch 2 and my Pixel buds pro","525":"Ive been seeing the promotions and with the Pixel 9 Pro series you get 200 credit after your phone ships Use that credit towards the new buds and its 30 minus tax And after you get 30 of credit for your preorder of the Buds The Buds Pro 2 come out later so youll have enough time to get all the promotion deals Pretty neat ","526":"This is simply inexcusable even under 10 k phones have less bezels","527":"I would regard myself as a tech guy My phone plan allowed me to switch to a new phone as often as I want I have tried alot of android brands OnePlus Samsung Moto previous Pixel phones Each time I found myself switching back to the iPhone due to various reasons including app optimization camera quality audio quality software etc I just felt like iPhone was the most well rounded phone Having switched to the Pixel 9 Pro I genuinely feel like google hit the mark with this phone Camera quality is seriously amazing Friends and family will literally ask me to take pictures for them after seeing pictures Ive previously taken  Problems Ive had with previous generations of Pixel phones have been directly addressed including cell reception problems audio sounding tinny fingerprint scanner being slow  The AI features have been tossed around as gimmicky but I genuinely use them so much For instance Ive been wanting to try more foods so Ill literally ask Gemini to create me a spicy Indian dish with chicken and add all ingredients to my list along with instructions on how to cook and itll do it effortlessly Using the AI Live feature as job interview prep has been amazing Itll ask me questions and rate my responses I actually used Add me on a family trip this weekend and it worked effortlessly App optimization seems to have improved I use Snapchat and Instagram stories alot and the camera is great on there as well Although iphone is definitely better I feel like theres finally an established ecosystem The watch is much improved with the addition of a bigger size Ive had the buds 3 for about a week and theyve been nothing but great Although not directly related to Google RCS becoming more mainstream has made messaging iPhone users significantly better  If youre on the fence on switching  Id suggest on doing so I have a feeling youre worried about missing iMessage FaceTime and the camera quality But the new additions have not made me thing about this once  Ive had this phone for a month and have loved every bit  I actually went full send and purchased the watch as well as the buds Full ecosystem If you have any questions about the switch let me know ","528":"Hey Pixel fansAnyone else feeling burned by Google right now I preordered a Pixel 9 Pro last month hyped to get my hands on it Now just weeks later they launch a new promo with a WAY better tradein value for my old Pixel 7 Pro AND free Pixel Buds Pro 2Seriously Google This feels like a slap in the face to those of us who were early adopters and showed faith in the phone  Its incredibly frustrating to be penalized for preorderingHas anyone else experienced this  Did Google offer any solutions ","529":"Just wanted to drop my thoughts on the Pixel 8 Pro after coming from an iPhone 15 Pro Max Im really tired of Apples walled garden and not being able to install whatever I want so I decided to give Android another shot Last time I used Android was with the S8 and Pixel 4 and while I loved the OS the apps just werent as good as iOSFast forward to now and honestly Im disappointed with the Pixel 8 Pro I actually liked the Pixel 4 better maybe it was the form factor or Android 12 but it just felt right in ways that the P8P doesnt The OS now is fine but not great though I really liked the home screen with the Microsoft launcher But man the apps on Android are still a mess Everythings buggy and Android 15 14 feels worse than 12 in a lot of ways Notifications are a pain the lock screen is dumb and not as customizable as iOS which is just crazy Trying to play a song from Spotify on my Sonos speakers almost gave me an ulcer What really made me want to go back to iOS was the Pixel Watch That thing is trashits small buggy laggy and the apps barely work The photos from the P8P were fantastic so no complaints there as expected Pixel Buds Pro were really good again no complaints there But overall I was just let down and really wanted it to be better Im so over iOS and Apples way of squeezing money out of you for everything but I might try the P10 or P11 and see if things improve by then Sorry if youve heard this kind of thing a million times just wanted to share for anyone else whos thinking the same switch","530":"I am a pixel guy always have been always will be I have the watch the phone and the Pixel buds pro the entire ecosystem etc I am honestly quite frustrated that its so hard to find a good case for the buds pro or trying to find a case for the pixel buds that Isnt made of cheap silicone that will just slip off the shell doesnt have a clip loop on it has a fun personalized design of my own interestsIt just overall sucks that every one on etsy who can do this cant modify it for pixel and only has designs for airpods dbrand doesnt have anything casetify doesnt there is nothing I feel like the pixel buds are big enough since they will do other google products but why are the products for pixel buds out there so limited I had this feeling last year but thought I would wait a bit but this year around its still barren out thereThe only ones I have been able to find are expensive leather cases which is fine but not much room for personalization Hell I saw personalized cases for some of those cheaper 20 skullcandy buds before I saw a good one for the pixels EDIT I have elected to start a support group just for people who want more variety in their pixel Bud Pro cases Away from this elitist no pixel Bud rhetoric Give me personalization Damn it","531":"Made the decision to get the buds and love it My first experience on earbuds with noise cancelation and pass through features and love it Should of made the jump on these when I got my pixel 9 but I instead got the watch First time Ive been brand loyal to a company I do not have any regrets The sound is decent enough  since Ive been using iems mostly","532":"had an earlier post about some minor drama with getting mine but they FINALLY came in last night thoughts so farLOVE the smaller size so much honestly if that were the only change made to them Id be happy loved the first gen pros but personally I have small ears so they stuck out of my ears quite a bit these have a lower profile which just looks better love this aesthetic of little white discs in my earsfit is SO much better first gen would fit ok and ive worn them for hours at a time with no problem but if I were ever working out in them or even just eating a lot theyd slowly come out of my ears which was annoying these stay rock solid in my ears so far even light tugs dont make them come out the twisttoadjust stabilizer thing actually seems kinda useful I can see mysellf actually wearing these around my house way more often now switched back to using medium ear tips cuz of the better fit used the small ones on the first gen to get it further in my ear due to its larger sizeweird quirk about the smaller size the touch surface area is smaller and based on how they fit in my ears positioned different than the first gen so touch controls felt kinda awkward at first and I missed the surface a few times especially volume swiping I suspect Ill get used to this after a few daysweeksANC is def more powerful granted Ive only tested them in my room so I havent fully tested them outside but my first gen would bring my ceiling fan to a very low hum these ones eliminate my ceiling fan completely I was caught off guard how quiet my room became transparency mode seems solid too but my voice sounds a bit more robotic than the previous gen again gonna try more today and might update this later also smoother transitions between anctransparencyconversation detection seems better detects when I STOP talking better it seems might turn this off later but Ill try it for a bit turned it off for the first genthe sound effects are more pleasant connecting audio switching etc and feel more thought out also audio switching works way better AND smarter when connected to my phone  watch and I turn on my Chromebook it knows to disconnect from my watch and to my Chromebook and not disconnect from my phoneand of course they sound good out of box sound is super neutral which maybe be fine for most but feels kinda lacking for me personally luckily the EQ makes up for it and now they sound great never had any issues with sound from the first pros and idk if they even sound better per se but theyre solid nonetheless I put my EQ preference above in case u wanna try itthese are super early thoughts and Ill actually be out and about using them today to put them through their paces but already I think Ill like these a lot and be using them ALL the time ","533":"It never was a mindblowing phone but it was a well round phone to begin with And it is still true after 2 years of useFirst what I like the most is the fact I only need to deal with Google Account that I use for Gmail and Youtube anyways No seperate Apple or Samsung account needed Second the battery degradation has been minimal which was not the case for all phones I have used It was acceptable to begin with and it is still acceptable Maybe that is because it has 5000mah and I am not feeling any effect of degradation Third Pixel Buds Pro Again it is not the greatest in term of sound quality and it simply works extremely well with my pixel and iphone with no glitch Fourth monthly security updates and first to try newest Android Something you cannot take granted in the world of Android Most samsung phone waited until late Dec 2023 for A14 For A15 it will not be until next yearI think my P7P will be strong for another two years before I consider upgrading","534":"So Ive been using the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for a day now and Im pretty happy with them overall Heres the breakdown  Comfort  Fit These things are TINY  Way smaller than the first gen and they feel great in my ears Havent had any issues with them falling out even during runs  Sound Quality The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro  Its clear and balanced and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds Ive been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles wont like these but I disagree The profile is flat and natural Things sound how theyre supposed to sound like a mostly true studio quality You can turn the bass up if you need more  ANC Noise cancellation is solid Its on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds my previous daily driver and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear  Transparency Mode  This is where they really shine Transparency mode is fantastic  it feels super natural almost like youre not wearing earbuds at all This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many Ive tried these are hands down the best  Multipoint Works seamlessly  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues  Case The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original which is a nice touch The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case  Mics Mic quality is very clear  Touch controls Basically no difference here Ive never had issues with the touch controls on previous generationsOverallThe Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original Theyre comfortable sound great and have excellent transparency mode  If youre looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone these are a great optionLet me know if you have any questions","535":"So I received my Pixel Buds Pro 2 yesterday and after playing around with them for a bit Im seriously unimpressed They sound pretty good in normal mode no ANCtransparency just passive noise isolation but when I enable ANC or transparency it sounds super tinny and sibilant sounds are super harsh Is this just my pair Or has anyone else experienced this Im just wondering if I should go through customer support to get a replacement pair or wait until a firmware update to address the problem ThanksEdits1 Ive performed a factory reset on the buds and set them up again but the issue still persists2 I am currently using them with my Pixel 9 Pro and Ive been using my Soundcore Liberty 4 NCs with it for about a month before I got my Pixel Buds with no issues3 I have tried my Pixel Buds with different genres of music and EQ settings and have gone between them and my Soundcore Liberty 4 NCs for comparison The sound curves between the 2 are obviously very different but thats how I was able to confirm the significant loss in audio quality when ANCtransparency are enabled4 Toggling spatial audio onoff made no difference in audio quality when in ANCtransparency mode5 Restarting my phone did not resolve the issue6 Ive decided to return my earbuds and wait to get a new pair until these QA issues are resolvedmitigated Thank you to everyone who contributed their experiencessuggestions under this post","536":"HiI have a pixel 9

iPhone user Ive had the iPhone 7 since 2016 Im open to switching to Android even though Im familiar with iOS Google Pixel 9 Price in the Czech Republic 840 includes free Pixel Buds Pro 2 Some AI features might not be fully available or functional in my region Could anyone clarify which AI features arearent available in the Czech Republic iPhone 16 Price 950 Most people around me use iPhones so Id benefit from features like iMessage and AirDrop Im not tied to the Apple ecosystem I dont own an iPad Mac or AirPods I use exclusive Apple apps like AirDrop or FaceTime only a few times a year Im unsure if Apples AI features will be fully available and functional in my region  and whether theyll live up to the hype What Im Looking For Im impressed by the AI capabilities of both phones I want a phone that will last 5 years I dont play demanding games I primarily use my phone for productivity social media etcWhat are your thoughts Any advice or insights especially about AI features and longterm usability for either phone would be greatly appreciatedI will be posting this on both Goodle and Apple subreddits to get opinion of both groupsThank you very much everyone","538":"Basically I wanted to recreate this alarm clock from the 1970shttpss3filescore77comblogimages115854081107023tChUiEOLBjpgI was able to edit the file from this videohttpsyoutubeL3nWw8qSYgkt216 and now got everything to fit with my pixel 8 with a case You can see me using the dock herehttpsiimgurcom7IJ8KcGjpegI think I got it looking pretty close to the originalMy version fits two regular MagSafe chargers one for my pixel 8 and another for my pixel buds pro on top","539":"Ive been looking here for other reports but I didnt see anything really similar to this issue  However a few people seem to experience it too see herereport on rpixelbudshttpswwwredditcomrpixelbudscomments1ik6yqxpixelbudspro2randomlyoneoftheearbudsutmsourceshareutmmediumweb3xutmnameweb3xcssutmterm1utmcontentsharebutton To keep it simple while playing sound usually music my left bud suddenly stops playing Sound keeps playing on the right one and both stay connected to my phone Pixel 8a latest stable version Android 15 Touching the bud still pauses the music noise cancellation still works but no sound It sometimes comes back if I pause then play then pause multiple times or play with random settings such as noise cancellation but sometimes the only workaround is to put it back in the suitcase for a few seconds Also both buds seems a bit slow to process commands when it happens  It can happen 4 times a day and then no issue another day Did a factory reset nothing changed It seems like it appeared after the last update release 3144Anyone has been experiencing thisEDIT  its been a while now still happening Support was not helpful Plot twist today the issue changed sides all of a sudden and it happened with my right bud I suspect a connectivity issue with multiple devices used my buds for two days without my pixel watch connected and the problem didnt show up Took my watch with me today and it happened again Ill try with and without it for the week and let you know a similar issue had happened before in Android 14 and was only patched two months later with Android 15SECOND EDIT  was hoping some fixes with Android 15 QPR2 but nothing Im pretty sure the bug only happens when my phone is connected to my pixel watch while playing on my buds Connectivity issue again","540":"LONG POSTI know there have been loads of posts asking this question so I thought I would let you know my experiences of running a Pixel 9 Pro XL and iPhone 15 Pro Max in tandem for a month and what I have noticedPlease note these are just my opinions and observations some may be wrong and I just havent discovered ways of doing things yet  I also ran an Apple Watch Ultra and Pixel Watch 3 since release day too so will mention those at the endTLDR   Both phones have plusses and minuses and both are excellent you wont be disappointed with either Watches AW Ultra has a better battery and is tougher but more expensive than the PW3 but the PW3 seems better at tracking sleep and fitness for me see comment about HR readings on UltraiPhone iOS18 observationsTap top of screen to scroll up is a feature I really miss on the Pixel  Its so useful note I am aware of the android app that does this but its flaky and crapPlaying music hands free using Siri  if Im cooking I can tell Siri to play music and it does it  Pixel Gemini wont as it says it needs to be unlocked first Very irritating  There is a workaround for this which is to use your Pixel Watch if you have one as an extended unlock item and use your home address as extended unlock but there shouldnt need to beAdd reminders handsfree using Siri  same as above  I can tell Siri to add a reminder about something and it does it every time pretty much perfectly  Pixel again asks to be unlocked firstAdd locationbased reminders hands free using Siri  can ask Siri to remind me to do something when I get home  I have no idea what Gemini is doing here  Most of the time it just says it cant do that but occasionally it says it has done it but nothing happens  And very occasionally it adds a Google keep reminder that doesnt announce itself but is there  This is my biggest bugbear with GeminiCustomising lock screen better on my iPhone in my opinion  I love swiping for different colours looks and backgrounds interfacing with my photos and stuff  And I LOVE the multicoloured timeUsing collections of images as lock screen pictures  this is such a brilliant feature I was astonished to find Google no longer do this  I can make a folder of family photos and have them swap on my lock screen Why cant Pixel again yes Im aware there is software for this but I havent managed to find one thats free that works the same without ads or isnt flaky etcInteraction generally between calendar reminders and Siri is just more flexible and powerful than on the Pixel  Every option I need is on there  Location based reminders repeating adding locations with a link to Maps everything  Pixels is a bit of a mess and tasks is so limited BafflingBouncing animated photos  where you can get a topshot image eg short video and select it to bounce back and forth This can produce some really cool effects and looks good in the photos app  Not possible on PixelCopy and paste from phone to MacBookiPad and viceversa  This is such a handy feature and I use it all the time  Obviously Pixel is unable to do thisAirPlay to my Sonos speakers in Apple Music Yes Im a weirdo and use AM not Spotify  I love being able to cast to speakers through AM not the Sonos app Yes I know Spotify can cast to any Sonos speakers though which AM cant natively so this is a bonus for PixelThe Journal app  I actually use this and there is no equivalent Pixel app as default happy to hear peoples recommendations here for one which works with iOSAndroidWiFi QR codesshare WiFi password  this is new in iOS18 and is really handy as it works cross platform As far as I know it isnt on PixelSafari reading mode  I hate adverts I mean I really really HATE modern advertising  So I use this feature all the time  Pixel does not have it But actually Pixel has a better solution to this with an app from Google  See my comments on my Pixel listRemoving annoying ads in Safari  another iOS18 feature God I love this Just delete all those shitty irritating adverts and read in peace Works in MacOS tooMeasurements tool  I use this quite a lot in my job and its great  I work in Health and Safety and often need to measure room sizes  The measure tool works really well Image crop to screen size  another small but neat feature  If you zoom in on an image to fill the screen a box comes up asking you if you want to crop the image to make a perfect wallpaper sized imageSwipe down to search is much much more comprehensive than Swipe up to search in Pixel I use this feature a lot and its great  In fact I use this to do almost everything  You can search for videos photos by person or by subject eg dog beach York Minster etc music emails images apps news stories anything  Its brilliant  The Pixel one is just really really limitedKeyboard space bar moved cursor in any direction on the Apple keyboard the Google one only moves left and right This is tedious and annoying when the spelling or change is at the start of the message and fruitlessly tapping close to it is annoying  Apples solution is just better hereNote on keyboards I have come to realise that I used to endlessly moan about the Apple keyboard and how annoying it was but the Pixel one is as bad for me so it must be down to my swiping inaccuracy in the main There is no noticeable difference for me between themNight view mode in landscape at night is great and works really well as a bedside clock  And a wave of the hand brings up the time in red at night if you wake up  Really nice featureCalendar entries If you ask Siri to tell you your calendar entries it will tell you all of them including shared calendar entries Gemini can only tell you Google calendar entries  Siri is pretty shitty generally but this is one area it really nailsApple Pay is less faffy and seems far more reliable than Google Pay for me so far I seem to keep having to unlock my Google Pay and reswiping every time  And if I have a store card it just gets completely confused  And I often have to fish around to get the machine to read my phone  Apple Pay just works logically and perfectly every single timeApple fitness on the watch works really well with synchronising exercise and videos together setting reminders to work out and so on  Just really well thought outScreen attention and by extension face unlock is much better on the iPhone Pixel locks the screen if I am wearing my reading glasses or in a dark room sometimesNow for my Pixel observationsNote these are for Google Pixel Pro 9 XL and Android 14Now playing on the lock screen is brilliant for a music fan like me Just love love love this featureNow Playing list saving all music it has heard and having a shortcut on the home screen  So I dont even need to pay attention now I can take a look later at what the song was  Such a cool featureWatch later for YouTube suggestions previews in Netflix accessed directly from notifications  This is brilliant and so much easier than ApplesNotifications are a bit better generally but I  particularly love YouTube suggestions that I can cast to my TV by a single tap from the notification or adding something to a watch list suggestion from Three BBC etcReplying directly to messages from the notifications is great too  Apple just doesnt do thisCast to my Sonos speakers in Spotify I dont use it but my daughter does and its really cool to cast in the Spotify app to any Sonos speakers iPhone can only cast to some of my Sonos speakers not all of themGemini generally better than Siri by a mile except having to unlock phone nonsense and points mentioned above regarding calendar and location based reminders etc Its such a shame it isnt all integrated properly because it frankly makes Siri look embarrassing for most stuff  Night and day better for asking about events places facts news stories pretty much anything Siris Ive found this on the web is embarrassing and its not going to be until at least first Quarter 2025 before it improvesPixel screenshots is really handy too just started using this and find it useful  Its great you can create reminders from it as well but why does it not back it all up  AnnoyingNight Sight camera is amazing  Four minute long exposure images very coolNot sure whether I prefer Google Photos or Apple for memories editing and so on  They are pretty closely matched for me Not sure I like the iOS18 photos app yet to be honest so Google Photos probably gets the nod here at the moment but its very close  Both are some of the best software that Google and Apple have to offerGemini live isnt there yet  The DEI and  preaching crap it keeps bringing up is really annoying I dont need my phone to remind me that all people are equal or women should be respected every time I ask for a fact about employment figures thanks Google  It also needs to be able to talk to normal Gemini to create links show photos play music and so on And do it when the phone is still locked GoogleCall screening  I havent used it yet but presuming it works its a great featureThe reading mode in Safari is something I mentioned that I love for the iPhone  Google has a free download called Reader mode and you can set it up to activate using a two finger swipe up from bottom of screen  this is actually better than iOS in some ways because it works in the news reader and loads of other apps too It doesnt include images though which the Apple Safari one does This doesnt come preinstalled thoughRecorder app with summary and text translation is a great featureSplit screen although it is a bit flaky on Android 14  Reddit always crashes using it for example  Maybe they will fix it for Android 15 or remove itHold for me Amazing if it works again I havent used it yet thoughDirect my call as aboveNotification history is a nice touch  being able to look back at all my notifications if I accidentally deleted one NiceGemini feature ask about this screen  option appears if this is available on the screen and you can ask questions about it Works quite wellSelecting text via the app switcher is niceGoogle news  you can block any providers you dont like completely Apple news leaves a big sign there saying you have blocked this news provider  click here to unblock which is a big screw you from Apple as far as I can seeGoogle lens although this is coming in iOS is quite cool tooMagic eraser is really good for removing things from photos works far better than I thought possible Again it is coming to iOS in the coming months  I used the beta though and it was poorNow a couple of observations about smart watchesApple watch Ultra has better battery life but the PW3 will still happily get you through 24 hours including sleep tracking working out and listening to musicSleep tracking seems more accurate on my Pixel Watch 3 my AW seems to badly underestimate deep sleepExercise stuff seems pretty similar although I should note that on my Ultra my HR monitor always disconnects corrupting my data  Very annoying  Note that all my normal AW did not do this and were fineIt is much easier and better to get new watch faces on the Pixel Watch On AW this is really flaky and annoying if you arent using the standard facesUltra is far tougher than the pixel Watch Im still nervous about scratching my PW3I personally prefer the strap system of the Apple watch Still waiting for my pixel buds pro 2s so no comparison there yetWell I hope anybody looking to move between Pixel and Apple finds some of this useful  Im sure I will get plenty of posts with solutions for Pixel that are like iPhone features If so thanks  And remember these are just my observations and opinions","541":"Got the Pixel Watch 3 four months ago after

really miss anything Major drive for the switch was Samsungs camera difficulty with quick point and shoot motion pictures of my pets and niecenephew indoors So far the 9 pro hasnt disappointed Have never put much stock into benchmark numbers and the 9 pro xl does everything I need it to do in normal daily use with good solid 8h sot battery life I still got my Samsung s24u for use at home mostly

on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold This new setup works specifically to fit the 9 Pro Fold but because of the uneven weight it requires some form of magnet on the phone to sit perfectly straight Im using the

them ","547":"After switching fully from an iPhone 12 to a Pixel 9 I leaned in hard on the switch and got the Pixel Buds Pro 2 The quality of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in both sound and usability is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the Airpod Pros 2 Im no tech guru but as an average consumer who listens to music while doing admin work in the office or while running outdoors the sound quality on these things Pixel Buds Pro 2 is magnificent The bass quality had me dancing almost right away And the noise cancellation works SO wellAs far as usability is concerned it always drove me nuts on the Airpod Pros 2 whenever Id need to switch songs while I was out for a run I hated having to squeeze both sides of an airpod multiple times just to change a song go back or pause Perhaps its just me or the shape of my ears but whenever I would squeeze the airpod Id have to quickly readjust the airpod in my ear The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are so simple to use a quick tap on the outside of the bud does the job Accessing Google Assistant or enabling Noise Cancellation feels so easy to doAlso I love that there are color variations to choose from on the Pixel buds This may not be important for everyone but it is to meIt was worth every penny switching over to the Pixel Buds Pro 2 from the Airpod Pros 2 If both the Pixel Buds and Airpods worked well on iPhones Id still always choose the Pixel Buds not that I ever plan to go back to an iPhone after the P9 I hope you liked my review Have a great day","548":"Hi  please help me decide Since I had to return the 3rd pair of Pixel buds pro 2 I dont want

cloud drive and gemini advanced pro that came with the pixel Youtube premium that comes with youtube music Pixel 9 pro XL Rolex Batman mechanical watch Google Fi cell service Chrome browser as its more compatible with many features on websites and the auto translate is awesome So why did I switch The pixel seems to be more advanced and do more things than the iphone even in prior pixel years The hardware SUCKED compared to iphones in the past Now the pixel hardware is superb and the softwareAI features are an awesome start for our world into AI In other words I got bored of the iphone and switched to pixel which makes me more excited to use daily Would I switch back to iphone full time use one day Sure maybe But for now I got the best of both worlds as my iphone as my secondary phone

have seen others have had their issues resolved or rectified after posting here and following the subsequent exposure to their issues Seems Google does not care unless there is an outcryTo summarise what happened I ordered a the 9 Pro XL directly from Google Store with an estimated delivery date of 22nd August I have ordered the 6 Pro 7 Pro 8 Pro Buds Tablet etc all before with no issues When I received the delivery box it already had some damage to it Therefore I immediately took photos of the entire unboxing process and lo and behold the phone was not in the actual phone box and instead there had been additional tissue paper stuffed inside to fill the spaceI immediately went to Google support and have been battling with them over 3 weeks with over 20 emails sent from my end with very little response from them They are refusing to help and are basically claiming that DPD tracking shows the package is delivered which means the phone must be in there When I contact DPD they said their contract is with Google so any missing items I need to raise with Google and theyll have to rectifycorrectGoogle Store support both via email or telephone support is zero help and I am really feeling helpless now as its nearing 3 weeks and theyve ignored my past 4 emails sent to them over the past week Can somebody please assist or help what I should do from here as a UK customer I do not want to do a chargeback as I have EVERYTHING on my Google account so do not want to risk losing it allTLDR Phone stolenlost from inside delivery box images taken and sent to Google Zero assistance or

the XL I wanted when they were handing them out with Pro buds 2 They reduced the prices of the phones by 100 but also reduced the value of tradeins by 100 No free Pro buds 2 also Im so pissed because I expected the deals to better considering they just handed out 30 discounts to some peopleNow Im thinking should I wait and see if the prices still drop unlikely or wait till after black Friday and see if the XL  Pro buds 2 is available again ","552":"I received my PBP2 on Oct 1 and immediately after taking them out for a run noticed a clickingpopping sound with each step Contacted support who

response over the phone was that they will not forward me to a supervisormanager nor would they put me in touch with the legal departmentTheir best solution is for me to initiate another replacement

anymore cause the sales failed is that really truei also could wait for the 9 pro xl but the bigger expected price and the design i hate the leaks of the back idk are making me think if it is even worth it it seems like the only new features are AI things that do not arrive in the EU anyways so no big WOW for me what would you guess is the preorder bonustldr what would you do in this situation as a android and especially a google fanand if you wanna know how it happened or are interested in my life issuesi got stolen by a nice guy when i was working on a cityevent working in a marketing department i was sitting on a sunchair with my phone on my belly when suddently one of my companys tents flew away by the wind in the face of a woman i instantly rushed to her trying to help a few seconds later my mind realises that my phone is not with me anymore i look behind and the friendly guy runs away with it yeah my bad police was alarmed but werent able to do much more i already tried to talk to my boss bud sadly its not covered due it being an easy steal and included no breaking in or smth welp","555":"I preordered my Buds 2 Pro on Sept 1 and they arrived today Sydney Australia Early impressions and comparions with Sony WF1000XM4 below Note that I bought then immediately sent back the original Pixel Buds Pro when they were first released in favour of keeping the XM4s As others have said theyre very small and light Fit feels good Im not sure I have the right sized tips in yet Im just using the mediums so far but they definitely feel secure They dont move at all when I shake my head around The real test though is sweat Ill wear them on my walk tomorrow hopefully to test if the seal breaks continually Thats the usual problem I have with buds I pretty much solved it with Comply tips on the XM4s Oh and I tested eating with them in and they didnt move YMMV but great for me I could sleep in these but I have pretty big ears so they dont stick out on me  Slept in them last night All playback controls work every time play pause skip etc I REALLY like that the confirmation beep on skip track is slightly delayed On the XM4s its immediate and I often dont hear it because all I can hear is my tap This is compounded by the fact that the XM4s controls are much harder to hit cleanly so I often end up pausing single tap when Im trying to skip double tap Volume swipe works every time Tap and hold for assistant works every time Assistant is fast and helpful I believe its using my phones chosen assistant I prefer Google Assistant to Gemini still Slight issue the assistants voice MAY be a little too loud for my liking I havent tried reducing it yet and Im not sure I want to because itll probably be a good volume when Im most likely to use it while walking Sound quality is very good Hard to say if its better than the XM4s because I have both EQd But I like the PBP2 setup better than the setup Ive got going on the XM4 at the moment Its all a lot cleaner but still very prominent and clean bass The XM4s sound muddy by comparison I may be able to close that gap by adjusting my EQ but havent tried yet and probably wont Theyre not a patch on my 50 IEMs for sound quality but thats to be expected Eartip seal check didnt work Said there was too much noise even though I was sitting completely still in a quiet room Hearing wellness feature is cool I often worry I have the volume too high but it says Im OK  Thats at about 80dB Conversation detection isnt working out of the box Ive looked hard and theres no setting for it I Googled it and can see that other people have experienced this problem One guy said it magically appeared after a few hours so Ill keep checking back Apparently my firmware is up to date so Ill just have to wait  Yep the toggle setting just appeared after a few hours Weird And yep its good Kicks in in about 12 seconds Love the case Its better than the Pixel Buds A case and definitely better than the XM4 case With the XM4s I always seem to choose the wrong side to open the lid from It seems like a trivial thing I know but still Putting in and out of the case is easier than with the original Pixel Buds Pro Not yet easier than the XM4s but I suspect thats just a question of getting used to it  muscle memoryI cant think of anything else to mention but if you have any questions feel free to ask If I think of anything else later Ill edit my original postEDIT I believe ANC is significantly better than the original Buds Pro from memory They were nowhere near as good as the XM4s The Buds Pro 2 are actually better than the XM4s However its important to note that I have different tips on the XM4s now Back when I compared them to the original Pixel Buds Pro I was using the stock tips probably medium Im now using Comply tips size small So its possible the seal isnt quite as good The seal still FEELS as good and the bass is as good as I remember it being back then so I dont think theres a seal issue but you never know The box with the tips in it is very good Makes it easy to keep them separated My right ear is hurting a bit but I think thats because I tried the small tip in that ear for a while and I think they were jammed in further or a hard surface was pushing on my ear where it wasnt with the medium Ive switched back to the medium and will report back on this later Call quality is good I just had a 25 min phone call with my boss and he said he could hear me clearly He said it sounded like I was a bit further from the mic but also that that may be because he was outside a loud restaurant in the wind ie It may have been a problem at his end Ill report back on this too I cant get Gemini Live to work properly I can invoke it with the magic words but it cant seem to hear me after that I can use Google Assistant by pressing and holding my right bud though and thats fine for me Gemini will cost money after the first year  Actually I think this may be my own stupid fault I have a1 month free trial but I havent activated it so I suspect thats why its not working Im not interested in paying 30 per month for AI so I doubt Ill try it No sound leakage At least according to my wife Im listening at 80db lying next to her in bed and she said she cant hear it at allIm very interested to see how well it cancels wind noise when listening to media The XM4s do a good job of thatSUMMARY AFTER SEVERAL HOURS USE Theyre very good Ill be keeping them and will probably sell the XM4s Biggest reasons comfort fit touch controls case removing from case One word convenience So far theyre exactly what I need from a pair of buds like this Very good allrounders and everything is easy I wouldnt buy them for DEDICATED music listening ie sitting and listening with eyes closed but for listening while DOING theyre great Since buying IEMs I dont think Id ever buy TWS buds for dedicated listening although Ive not tried anything 500 but I suspect Ill end up listening to more music on these and more of each song simply because I can easily and comfortably listen while doing other stuff I havent had a chance to exercise in them yet but Im betting thatll be fineEDIT  I went for a good walk with these in this morning 1hr 40min of hard walking Sweated quite a bit Spent about 13 of the walk listening to an audiobook and about 23 on the phone They felt secure the whole time and pretty comfortable A slight discomfort but nothing terrible I didnt feel driven to adjust the fit the whole time When I did twist and push when I got home though the right one had lost its seal Also I noticed a rustling sound with every step I believe this was slight movement of the tips It wasnt a showstopper but its not something I hear with my XM4s and the Comply buds Ive now switched to a pair of Spinfit CP155 tips so see how they go Just sitting they feel a little more seated but I wont know for sure until I go for a walk tomorrow morning Ill report back then My phone call recipient was my boss and I talk to him a lot on my walks He said there was less wind noise on these than normal It felt nicerefreshing to not have the huge XM4s in my ears Not that the big body of those buds makes them uncomfortable for me but you still know theyre there eg You cant feel the movement of air on that part of your outer ear ANC wind noise management touch controls all worked fineEDIT The Spinfits are no good The buds dont charge in the case with them on and they made the same rustling noise I tried a pair of Symbio tips which are a hybrid with silicone outer and foam inner and they fit the buds fine didnt stop them charging although they seem to impede the magnet a little when dropping the buds into the case and they dont adversely affect the bass They also seem not to make the rustling noise as much But they reduced the effectiveness of the ANC so for now Ive switched back to the stock tipsFINAL EDITIve decided to send them back After wearing them for several hours today I began to find them fairly painful in my left ear Bummer Have ordered a pair of Sony Linkbuds S instead","556":"Hi allSo my pair arrived this morning and I already have a few thoughts on them  Please bear in mind these are just my opinions and Im not a pro reviewer or anythingFirstly wow these are so small and light  They make my airpod pro 2s feel big  They are really comfy to wear too Setting up on my Pixel was a doddle and there was an update already to the software to 2117 for buds and 155 for caseThe sound on them for me is excellent and I like them as much as my Airpod Pro 2s  I havent played with the EQ and probably wont to be honest because songs are recorded at so many different levels youll be constantly fiddling with it so I just leave it as is  Im also over fifty now so my hearing isnt top notchThe noise cancelling is excellent and I would say as good as my Airpod Pro 2s as well so far All of it feels really nicely made the earphones snap into the case nicely and I look forward to seeing what the battery life is likeNow for the problemsNow this is the first pair of Pixel Buds I have owned but the touch stuff is seriously problematic under certain situations for me so far  I took the dog out for a walk to test them and everything was great initially but then it started raining and suddenly everything went to shit  Even though we were quite dry in a wood sheltering my fingers became damp and the earphones stopped responding  The music just stopped and the only way to get it to play again was using my phoneThen when I put my hood up and starting jogging back the hood must have kept brushing the tips and starting and stopping the music and putting the noise cancelling on and off  Very annoying Especially in the rain with a dogAnyway once this happened it was like the earphones crashed  Putting them back in the case then taking them out again got them working properly again  So I dont know if this is a software glitch or not but Im not going back out into the rain too test then againAnother thing is knowing where to tap them  You cant see the side of your head so you when you go to pause them for instance you tend to be putting the volume up and down and jumping forwards and backwards a track  Im going to give them a while but this is really annoying for me at the moment  Airpods just work so much better in this regardAnyway these are just my initial thoughts after a few hours  Perhaps after some use Ill get better accustomed to the pads and how to use them  I hope so because theyre lovely and sound and cancelling are greatEDIT Forgot to mention the Gemini integration is working really well so far in the limited use I have made for itEDIT2 multipoint connection works really really well for meEDIT3 after saying all that about the multi point its stopped working  Nothing will play on my Pixel now  I had to put the buds back in the box shut down all my media apps shut my MacBook and reopen media apps on my Pixel to get it to work  Poor  Hopefully sorted with an update sometime in the future Sigh ","557":"I switched to a Pixel 9 and now Im looking for new earbudsIm mostly trying to decide between Pixel Buds Pro 2 and Sony XM5

together with Pixel Phones and have some exclusive features but they never really go into details   So my question is what are those exclusive features and what makes it Great for Pixel Phone users Is it worth it to pick them over the Sony although they seem to be better overall","558":"Anyone else experience this Recently my pixel buds pro 2 have started to pause after skipping If I double tap it

why I want to ask some questions  is the camera the only thing about Google phones that stands out  is the overheating an issue when gaming clash of clans watcher of realms etc or just in generalThe features I love with Samsung and this may be available on pixel as well is the ability to snap 2 apps on the screen at the same time half and half so I can game on one and check reddit on the other

quite different from and cheaper than Pixel 9 series I honestly dont like the glyphs and find it quite distracting However I do think the phone as a whole is value for money So nothing phone 3a pro

introduce myself  My name is Stephen I am 24 and I am from Tennessee Lifelong Apple fanboy and user for over 10 years I was so invested into the ecosystem but I finally just realized that when the iPhone 16 dropped they werent doing anything new I mean they still had 60hz screens which is insane in 2024 I used to have this view that all Androids sucked and were poor in terms of user experience and what not   As of September 2024 I have officially sold my MacBook Pro iPad and apple watch ultra I have now swapped to a Pixel 9 Pro XL in Obsidian I will say I love this phone It feels like what most YTers call the iPhone of Android so I love this I even got the Pixel Watch 3 45mm and the Pixel Buds Pro 1 I love all of these They are incredible and my inner nerd and tech fanboy is enjoying this new way of using tech If curious I sold the macbook pro for a surface laptop 7 with the snapdragon Elite X processor in black   I appreciate you all taking the time to read my post and welcome me

just full of the same exact posts from previous generations factory resetting and RMAs Disappointing considering I have a pixel phone and want to give them my money After being scornes by them and

there was no announcement of new earbuds from them reviews werent TOO bad so I went for itAnd oh boy was it the worst experience Ive ever had from start to finishIt started with having to replace them for literally 4 times as they always kept disconnecting from my phone and didnt want to reconnect until kept in the case for 510 minutes Also every single one of them always had some degree of case defect as the lid didnt align to the rest of the case making an awful sound when closing Hey at least the last pair of earbuds seemed decent enough on this regard and only disconnected once every 1020 days it wasnt too bad after all Well unfortunately issues didnt end there Because of course how did I not think that they could have disparity issues Like they constantly and consistently dispaired making the left earbud play sound first and then came the right one And the only way to fix this was to stop any audio coming from them wait for a couple of seconds and then play again Oh also did I mention that they have ALWAYS had a kind of background noise when anything was playing It was horrible silence apparently cannot exist with them Pixel Buds Anyways issues persisted all the time Ive owned them and recently new ones started appearing such as the right earbud only lasting literally A QUARTER of the time the left one does Well this of course only happens when Im just listening to anything because when Im in a call they only last 1520 minutes And last but not least some of these buds sometimes think theyre charging when theyre actually not and sometimes they think the case is open while its actually notBefore anyone says anything yes Ive contacted multiple times Google support even with Google One and they always had the same troubleshooting process charge them and factory reset them Needless to say this didnt work everAnyways yes this looks like a rant and it probably is These Pixel Buds are the reason I will never again buy any more buds from Google they have absolutely awful support and theyre terrible on every aspect Ive also never owned any other wireless earbuds before so I cant even say theyre terrible compared to X No theyre terrible period All this for an even more awful price tag of 200  Thats disgusting And no Im not trying to boycott Google I own a Pixel phone and a Pixel Watch and theyre great Great price not so much for the watch but if we compare it to Apples and great functionalities But come on is this really all they can do with some earbudsI hope they fixed these issues on their newer buds but in the meantime I hope to have warned any potential Pixel Buds buyer You might have a terrible experience Thanks for reading","600":"Hey all Im having a weird issue with my new Pixel Buds Pro 2 This seems to only happen on my Pixel 9 Pro XL and combined with YouTube Music however I think the latter is only cause it plays louder than other apps Ive tested When listening to some music at max volume the sound will go like underwater for a few seconds before returning to normal I can reproduce this every time at the exact same point in the exact same song at max volume  If I pair my airpods to the Pixel this doesnt happen at all testing with the same songs in Youtube Music Equally if I pair my Pixel Buds with my Mac or Windows PC and play the same song at max volume it also doesnt happen Also Ive tried the normal YouTube app and the Android Apple Music app with the same songs and this doesnt happen either however Ive noticed that they sound slightly quieter than YouTube Music on the Pixel This also doesnt happen if I turn the volume down a bit with YouTube MusicI havent modified anything to do with volume its all as default Ive also noticed that if I turn off ANC this does not happen on YouTube Music either It seems to be purely YouTube Music on the Pixel at max volume with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 but Im thinking Youtube Music isnt the issue it just seems to play louder than any other source which is causing the issue Has anyone else had this issue","601":"Add me to the me too list for Pixel 9 Qi issues I know the articles floating around are focusing on the Pro XL but my nonPro Pixel 9 seems to have the issue as well1 Ive tried a few Magsafe charges with two different cases and none of them work They all show charging for about 10 seconds then show no charging Very reliably2 Ive grabbed a couple nonmagsafe Qi chargers that I bought from the Google Store the Pixel Stand 1 and the iottie dock has a second Qi charger for ear buds Neither of these will charge with any case on They both charge successfully with no case on the phoneIll be getting a Fold and a miniPro in next week Ill do more testing with those phones once theyre here I hope this is something Google can fix with a software update This is disappointingOn a side note In the process I created this overlay to figure out where the Qi coil is relative to the G Theyre pretty well aligned with each otherhttpsimgurcomgallerypixel9nonproqicoilalignmentHU6xDj7httpsimgurcomgallerypixel9nonproqicoilalignmentHU6xDj7","602":"Anyone use AirPods with Pixel phones Work ok I know you wont get all Apple features on an Android but what is missing and do they work fineIm thinking as Ive had AirPods in past and prefer them to buds that shove inside ear I prefer the AirPod type just rests in The new AirPod 4 has ANC now with same type of resting in ear otherwise I would be looking at Google Buds pro 2 imagine have better integration with Pixel phone but think they are the shove in ear type ","603":"Well I dont think Ill be buying the pro model anymore The first ones were bad then I got the 2022 pros because of a discount They lasted over a year but I cant get a replacement now for the right ear bud Im guessing because they now sell the buds pro 2 They still work if I turn the anc and transparency off but the right earbud is lower volume They screech if i dont I enjoyed them while they worked Ill say but the lower volume on the right isnt a good experience ","604":"I have a pixel 6 and would love an Xreal but concerned about compatibility with my Pixel 6 and the Pixel line in general Im also considering upgrading to the Pixel Fold so have similar concerns My primary use case for the Xreal is traveling on long international flights so being able to use Bluetooth earbuds

today and heres the quick and dirtyThe Good Fit These things are comfy Coming from AirPods Pro 2s I was worried but no pain even after hours of use Major improvement over the original Pixel Buds Transparency Mode So much better Almost on par with AirPods Pro 2s Sound A bit more bass but not a huge leap forwardThe Bad Call Quality The main reason I upgraded and its a letdown Sounds muffled almost like AirPods on an Android phone a bit of an exaggeration but you get the idea ANC Still not great AirPods are still the kings hereOverallIll give em a week but Im leaning towards a return The call quality is just a dealbreaker for mePS I made a quick video comparing the mics if anyones interestedhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvU8YO3arqvcEhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvU8YO3arqvcE","606":"Been seeing another uptick of poor experiences with the new Pixel hardware so wanted to throw in my positive experiences to mix things up This is NOT me minimizing those anecdotes or claiming anyone who has had issues is lying I am merely doing this to verify the concept of silicon lotteryPreOrdered the Pixel 8 Pro through my carrier it was 600 OFF before tradein and I effectively got it for about 150 after handing in my Pixel 7 In the first month or so I dumbassedly started tinkering w it before paying it off and ended up bricking it trying to install a Beta build Google warranty replaced it no questions asked in about a 3day turnaroundSince late October Ive been using the Unlocked replacement 8 Pro from Google alongside the Pixel Watch 2 and Pixel Buds Pro and I want for virtually nothing Having compared it to the Galaxy S24 and iPhone 15 Pro I find the way Pixel hardware marriages together to be just as fluid if not more so in certain areas than Apple Ive tried my hand at AirPods and an iPad I largely prefer the way Pixel plays nicely with my Tab S9 Ultra S Pen brings everything together Samsung is probably the most logical alternative for Android users at the moment I found the Galaxy a breeze to use but missing Pixel exclusivesAll in all silicon lottery My replacement was mandatory as the software bricking compromised the initial model so this isnt even technically the launch Pixel but it was a brand new model they sent and not refurbished so I consider it part of the launch batch Even while tinkering I have had zero heating issues lag or general bugs I can think of Kind of strangeJust putting here in case anyone is thinking of the Pixel ecosystem It works and it works damn well I enjoy seeing Google answer the efficiency concerns with each passing iteration I do still think they could do more as a trilliondollar company to speed things up but Im also not a giant tech conglomerate On mine and many others in my friendfamily circles end Pixel comes highly recommended here","607":"My Pixel Buds Pro 2 just a few months old were working fine but began to act weirdly not so long ago Happens not constantly but by my impression more and more often When I

always work or can take a long time to respondCons Ive used the PBP for almost two years and I cant say the PBP2 has better ANC Its definitely not on the same level as the QC UltraBose QuietComfort Earbuds UltraPros The ANC is amazingly good I have used the PBP PBP2 and AirPods Pro 2 and the QC Ultra has the best ANC by far When I put on the PBP2 I can feel the noise is reduced but its still present However the QC Ultra can completely isolate the noise most of the time or reduce it to an unnoticeable level I would say the PBP2 only has about 50 of the ANC capability compared to the QC UltraCons Its not integrated with my Pixel 9 and requires an extra app for settings The response time is not as fast as the PBP2 It usually takes 58 more seconds to connect to my phone than the PBP2 Switching between single and dual earbuds is also not as smooth as with the PBP2 The case is larger and doesnt have the same quality as the PBP2","624":"I got my new Jabras a couple of days ago Almost

in the Bluetooth audio settings in developer settings I changed it from 12 to 14 I tried to reset all my settings and pair everything the same and I found other issues which were mitigated by changing something with disabling Bluetooth le hardware offload but this left my headphones not sounding very good So I set it back to 12 and ever since all Bluetooth problems have been resolved it never cuts out anymore It connects faster than ever and doesnt have issues when switching between phone calls and media I was so close to sending this phone back I like everything else about it but this issue was a deal breaker for me luckily its now fixed ","634":"My Pixel buds pro have been acting up lately where the volume levels of both the earbuds are different until I use the gesture to increase the

anyone have a fix for this issue","635":"Hey Pixel Communityjust wanted to know from you guys and girls what do you think could come to the Pixel EcosystemHope we can have a good Discussion what Google maybe develop in the future1 If i remember correctly 2 years ago everyone thought we get the Pixel Dot or GSpot Airtag alternativ But still no sign if we get this or not Moto Tag is now here but still not as good as Airtags and Samsung Smarttags are only good with Samsung phones so what do you think2 After the Pixel buds pro 2 were a really good upgrade over older Pixel Buds do you guys think Google will release more Music  Audio products maybe something like Airpods 4 Earbuds without eartips but with ANC Also an Option would be something like the Nothing Ear Open or Shokz Open fit Air Open Ear buds Design or even with Eartips like from 1more S50 If we get the Pixel Buds pro 3 in 23 years i myself hope they add changeable Wingtips like the Soundcore Liberty 3 pro had3 Just an addition to Audio Products What do you think about Over ear headphones or bluetooth speakers also for outdoor usage like JBL does4 How will Chromebooks develop in the future Will they be more like Laptops or more like Tablets Will Chrome OS Stay and will become better or will it integrate Android more and more and maybe Chrome OS will become Android OS or something comepletly new5 Will we get a new generation of the Pixel Tablet Really would like to see Pixel Tablet Gen 2 with a better and cheaper Docking Station and maybe 2 Versions of the Tablet An 8 and an 11 Version I really would like to have a new tablet at home small 86 New Nest Products New Nest Hub Gen 3 Or will Nest fusion with the Pixel Tablet7 Pixel Glasses even if i think its not really much that needed8 What do you all think Google could develop in the future Let me know hereGreetings","636":"Ive had a Pixel phone and the Buds Pro for a while now and my current watch Galaxy Watch 4 is not working properly with my

Can I use my watch and buds with the Pixel ","638":"I would regard myself as a tech guy My phone plan allowed me to switch to a new phone as often as I want I have tried alot of android brands OnePlus Samsung Moto previous Pixel phones Each time I found myself switching back to the iPhone due to various reasons including app optimization camera quality audio quality software etc I just felt like iPhone was the most well rounded phone Having switched to the Pixel 9 Pro I genuinely feel like google hit the mark with this phone Camera quality is seriously amazing Friends and family will literally ask me to take pictures for them after seeing pictures Ive previously taken  Problems Ive had with previous generations of Pixel phones have been directly addressed including cell reception problems audio sounding tinny fingerprint scanner being slow  The AI features have been tossed around as gimmicky but I genuinely use them so much For instance Ive been wanting to try more foods so Ill literally ask Gemini to create me a spicy Indian dish with chicken and add all ingredients to my list along with instructions on how to cook and itll do it effortlessly Using the AI Live feature as job interview prep has been amazing Itll ask me questions and rate my responses I actually used Add me on a family trip this weekend and it worked effortlessly App optimization seems to have improved I use Snapchat and Instagram stories alot and the camera is great on there as well Although iphone is definitely better Although not directly related to Google RCS becoming more mainstream has made messaging iPhone users significantly better  If youre on the fence on switching  Id suggest on doing so I have a feeling youre worried about missing iMessage FaceTime and the camera quality But the new additions have not made me thing about this once  Ive had this phone for a month and have loved every bit  I actually went full send and purchased the watch as well as the buds Full

The only way to fix it is to either wait it out or restart the phoneAt first it seemed random and sometimes still is but I seemed to have tracked down what triggers it to the power buttonFor example if Im listening to something and the buds are working normally if I press the power button to look at my notifications the audio will start to distort Then if I close the screen wait a beat and press the power button again this can sometimes fix the issue and the audio goes back to normal Its not every time but it does seem like the two are connected It also feels like sometimes when a notification comes in this can trigger the audio to distort This is regardless if the phone is on silent or notIve tried unpairing the buds turning offon Bluetooth  neither of which work I dont currently have access to another pair of Bluetooth headphones so cant test if this is unique to my Pixel BudsPhone and buds are both on the latest firmware Hoping that its just a software glitch that

correct the original pixel buds did the same thing ","643":"I love my Pixel buds pro 2 and the transparency mode is really good except for one thing it amplifies loud noises to be even louder to the point where I it hurts and I think it might be harmful to my earsThere are usually two places I notice this and rush to turn off transparency mode in the subway when a metro approaches  on the street when an emergency vehicle passes with sirensIt feels like transparency mode just blindly amplifies everything and ignores the volume limit You could almost say it works a bit too wellPersonally I prefer using transparency mode in public so I properly notice everything happening around me but this makes it annoying to useHas anyone else noticed this I was surprised at first that this even happens at all given the new features around Hearing Welness","644":"March Available Stock and PricelistGoogle Pixel 7 128 US 2199000Google Pixel 7 Pro 128 JP 2499000Google Pixel 7 Pro 128 US

currently to ensure audio quality I scoured the Internet for troubleshooting ideas and tried them all I ended up connecting with Google support and they said my buds are defective and sent me a new pair I just received them and the microphone still will not pick up from the new buds So now Im wondering if the issue is my phone or a recent system updateThe earbuds microphone do not work when I make phone calls or record voice notes in any messaging app BUT I can toggle to the buds as a microphone option in the Recording app on my phone Has anyone had this issue Any tips to resolveI have tried everything from restarting my phone ensuring my device is updated uninstalling and reinstalling the pixel buds app clearing my Bluetooth cache factory resetting the earbuds ensuring the phone

feeling with the right earbud and now the ear tip seal check fails the right earbud no matter what I troubleshooted the issue by changing the ear tips and trying to adjust the fit to no avail Then I performed a factory reset on the buds and that made no difference either After some experimentation I noticed the plugged ear feeling is not as pronounced while noise canceling or Transparency is enabled but it is still there slightly I am now convinced the issue lies with the Active inear pressure relief feature in the right earbud The day I started having the issue I contacted Google Store support who were unable to help and referred me to the Pixel Buds Customer Care Team They said they would contact me by email It took about 30 hours to hear back from them yesterday and they asked for my full name shipping address and phone number I replied promptly with the information requested but I have not heard back from them as of now Hopefully I can get the right earbud or the whole set replaced quickly Its a shame because I really enjoyed them before this issue They were a big improvement over my old PBP in terms of ANC quality and comfort For now Im using my 2yearold PBP and I miss

started to happen exactly But around the time of the recent firmware update the microphones in my buds stopped working properly and are basically dead sometimes they work for a second but only

with different devices Pixel 8a Pixel 6a Win11 Laptop and the issue persists so its the buds not the phone Ive reset them twice but unfortunately that didnt change anythingHave any of you come across

buds were both in their  closed  case so they were disconnected from every device Plus I only paired them to my phone which was in Airplane mode with Buetooth WiFi and location turned offThe same behaviour occurred about ten hours later  while I was at work and they were in the closed case this time with telephone Bluetooth and WiFi on and then again while I was in the bus commuting back home but this time I was using themThis morning shortly after the first occurrance I contacted Google customer service hoping they know why that happened they told me to reset the buds and uodate the firmware but I already did that the night before because I learned I had to take ownership of the device Then they told me that this is an anomalous behaviour and offered  and suggested  to replace the buds using the warranty I accepted and received an email stating that they could eventually send me a refurbished article and honestly I do not want a refurbished item and I do not know if want to take the risk to get oneOn the other hand there is at least another reason that push me to replace them during the first day of use I heard a strange behaviour from the buds themselves which seemed like sometimes they skipped some audio samples for less than two seconds at the time resulting in very short robotic sounds Sorry but I do not know exactlty how to explain They do not do that anymore

last year and loved everything about it except the blurriness of kids and pets with photos  I sold the Galaxy and got a Pixel 9 Pro  Its a good phone but its pretty boring  Im also starting to get annoying little bugs like Notifications arent notifying me unless I unlock the phone recent problem and YouTube Music and YouTube sometimes just pause entirely for no apparent reason at all  The Galaxy had a lot I loved OneUI was much more fluid with more features Dolby Atmos made everything sound better especially podcasts which is the bulk of what I listen to on walks and during workouts The camera modes were really cool for example I used Single Take for my kids a lot and it got some of my favorite pictures of last year I used Edge Panels a lot and the fluidity of that was really great  I read somewhere on a YouTube comment section that the blur on kids and pets can be aleviated by switching to 12mp mode but I have no clue if that is true  Someone also suggested using Motion Photos and screenshotting what I wanted  this is a good idea too  I wish I had a recent Galaxy in front of me to test this stuff  Pixel has some really useful features but not sure if they make up for everything that Samsung has in that package  Aside from the nearly perfect pictures all the time Now Playing and Call Screening along with Voice to Text was always really strong  I have a phone I can trade in to Samsung and then sell my Pixel 9 Pro Id probably be left with paying about 300 out of pocket to make the switch which would include the new Galaxy Buds Pro    If money wasnt an object what

Sonys are slightly better overall but I do have a Pixel phone Are there any advantages using the Pixel buds with a Pixel phone that makes it worth it to get those over the SonysI already own xm4 Over Ears so Im already using the Sony AppPrice is around the same in my country 200","690":"Inspired by the words of our friend ufraspas How is it in person  Is it white white Or slightly offwhite like boneand by my questionsdoubts before purchasingreceiving the device is it white Is it as porcelain as the Pixel Fold Or more pure white like the snow Pixel 7a and Pixel 3 I am figuring other people may have the same doubtsSince I now have the device I just thought Id take a couple of comparisons pictures for the sake of clarityI must emphasize how much of the actual whiteness tone that you perceive looking at the attached picture is going to be affected by my Pixel 8 Pros camera lighting conditions when I took the pictures and calibration of your own display So dont take this comparison as a oh okay I see that white that means the porcelain colour really is that colour Dont Just use the pictures to judge the different tone compared to other already knownfamiliar whitesThats why I included in the images the clearly white Pixel 3 and the two Pixel Stands 1st and 2nd Gen I could have added the Pixel Buds Pro case and white Pixel XL too but I forgot and now cant be half arsed to redo everything  unless theres someone who specifically need it in case let me knowTo be clear the Pixel 9 Pro nonXL and the Google case are both porcelain colourNow personal thoughts I went with this colour because I absolutely dislike the hazelgray one and the blackobsidian didnt feel black enough I like black only if its a deep deep black I usually like pure white phones and stuff Pixel 3 indeed  but also loved the super white Pixel 7 and 7a but I was concerned that the porcelain Pixel 9 Pro wouldnt be really White well its probably not called something white for a reason Having seen the official imagesrenders on Google Store and the previous Pixel Fold I was expecting a very champagne sort of porcelainSo I was pleasantly surprised when the reviews came out and I could see the porcelain was actually rather white But I always wondered whether that had to do with colour grading etcSo when I received the device and unboxed it I finally saw the actual look The impression was that it was definitely less white than I had come to expect and wish following what I had seen in the reviews however it was still whiter and less warmgoldishchampagne than what the official renders made it lookSo not my ideal pure white but not even the veryoff porcelain white that I initially feared it would beIts just An average off whiteThe case on the other hand is a slightly different off white which Id place in the middle between the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 9 ProIf anyone has better pictures showing the tone more accurately next to some other white products feel free to share themhttpsimgurcomaUyR7BZHEdit oh a sort of disclaimer I am colourblind so take everything with a grain of salt ","691":"I dont want this to be all negative so Ill try my best and balance this rant as best as possibleFirstly its nice to once again have an HTC device after using the pixel for 2 days Ive realised its going to be me HTC and XDA back together like the good old days and thats always been good times for me So thats a definite 1 plus But Im here to have a lol at some of the dumb stuff because wow theres a lot to deal with I came from a rooted mi 11 with a semi customised miui and always hear people complaining and praising stock android over any skin especially miui but Im going to miss it Hopefully once Ive rooted my pixel and had a swing at trying to fix its problems I wont miss it at all So heres my list so far starting with a non phone issue Pixel buds I got the a series free so not the end of the world but who would want a pair of 100gbp earphones that have 1 second solid latency while watching anything other than yt You can buy 5 pound headphones from AliExpress that have less latency 0 out of 5 starsWhere the fek is photosphere gone I know the answer but seriously my gcam on my Xiaomi has a Google feature my Google phone doesnt and thats beyond ridiculous Shes a warm one I knew Id disapprove of the Samsung soc and yupp I sure do Theyd have been better slapping a midrange mediatek chip in than this thing Seriously silly logic as this phone gets warm without gaming 0 out of 5 stars for soc choiceHaptics are to strong on lowest touch setting and turning touch haptics off kills keyboard haptics even though theres a separate setting for keyboard haptics Silly Google Pro camera features I wont hit this one cause I know yall know and personally for me I dont care Raw files would have been nice but I just want my god damn photosphere back Camera gets 5 out of 5 stars regardless because its great The os does look nice I love the notification bar compared to miui the settings are layed out well the ai stuff is gimmickeee as fek but some of it is cool Gemini is available from APK mirror and works in the UK I havent tried to see if I can change to my favourite Aussie female voice though and will probably be turning it off by the end of the week Os gets 35 out of 5 It needs more options as linage with a few mods makes stock android the greatest The screen This might take me a while to adjust but as beautiful as it is its too warm White is yellowish and I cant cook it down because dumb Google wont let me This will be one of the main reasons I will root this device that the haptics ads and viper4android as I cant live without decent audioThe screen gets 4 out of 5 because I will get used to itThats about it If you made it this far

for my Pixel 7 Pro  I got Buds Pro 2 for free So I decided to pull the trigger and ordered Pixel 9 Pro XL Spoiler  I actually got full 531 euros as estimated by Google My 7 Pro was always in a case but I didnt have a screen protector so there were a few minor scratches over the 2 years that Ive used it But other than that the phone was in a perfect condition No cracks excellent battery life not a single mark anywhere else on the body or the camerasHere is the timeline31Oct2024  I placed the order01Nov2024  My new phone arrived04Nov2024  Tradein kit arrived I thought Id have to send the box and documents  USBC cable that came with the phone but there was only a small space for the phone itself and nothing else in the tradein kit DHL Express label and packaging with clear instructions were provided05Nov2024  I dropped off the old phone12Nov2024  I received an email stating that my phone has been evaluated and full refund of 531 euros is issuedOverall Im extremely pleased with how it went From ordering my phone and getting it literally the next day and getting my trade in money was less than 2 weeksI couldve done it even faster but couldnt drop off my old phone by the evening of the next day due to work I live in Ireland and phone came from The Netherlands and in a span of 24 hours it went to Netherlands to Belgium to Germany and finally arrived in ROF Modern EU shipping logistics are truly mindblowingI also sold the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for 200 because Ive already have Sennheiser Momentum 3 After all that I upgraded from Pixel 7 Pro to Pixel 9 Pro XL for less than 500 euros which is great Depending on how what Google offers in the future I might even consider upgrading every year instead of every 2 or 3 years since the price of previous generation phone might be higher so the upgrade price will be cheaperGood thing Ive switched from Samsung to Google Just feels like Im not getting ripped off by pointless features in my phone and feels like Im being appreciated as a customerThank you Google","716":"Every time I am using my pixel buds pro 2 and receive any kind of notification my audio pauses and when the notification is over it will not resume If I then press my bud it should play buty audio does not play Even If I ask Google to resume it wont I have to open my phone and press play on my phone to resume my audio I have looked through the settings on my buds but nothing comes up to change the behaviorHas anyone experienced this and been able to fix it","717":"Not sure if I have the right flair pixel 6 BP1124121010 sorry if its wrong

is this a feature or a bug for the beta","718":"Love these buds even without AptX LosslessAdaptive but Im wondering why the fallback codec is AptX Audio instead of AptX HD Audio Is this a limitation of the earbuds or the Pixel 9 Pro I suspect its the phone but I cannot seem to confirm what exact codecs are available on this phone I assumed the grayed out ones were available if the buds supported them","719":"For some reason my pixel buds pro balance is changing with my volume so if I have my volume on max I can only hear from the right earbud if the volume is 1 level off of mute its only the left earbud im using a Pixel 9 Pro XL any help appreciatedEdit More accurately actually it seems my phone volume button only affects the right earbud whilst changing the volume via the earbuds resets and changes both audio ","720":"I got my OG Pixel Stand a couple years ago when I luckily stumbled on a random cell phone store in Maryland that was selling it for 18 and the only thing wrong was that the box had been opened I gladly swooped in and bought it and it has worked almost perfectlyFunctionally it does its job very well but I find it difficult to place my phone on the stand properly on the first try and often have to pick the phone back up to place it on fully a few times for it to work I also have had problems with my Pixel Buds Pro taking twice as long as it should to charge due to me accidentally not putting it on the stand fullyDespite the annoyances I really love this device because I try to use wireless charging at every chance I get plus I have an overpriced wireless charging pad that I only assume is charging all the way to 100 but when it reaches 100 it stops charging and by the time I wake up in the morning my phone is at around 94 when I get up My OG Pixel Stand does not do this and thats the big reason I have stuck with itIf Google would release a Google Pixel Stand 3 I would swoop in and grab it but Google doesnt seem to be considering it in the near future Anybody share these feelings with me","721":"My left pixel bud pro earbud just started sounding tinny and low the other day Ive been contemplating just replacing the buds altogether with the

to purchase preferred care for my 9 Fold but I cant decide on a planIf I could get the 2 year plan and then extend it monthly on expiry I would definitely do that but I asked Google support about it and apparently it is not allowedThoughtsThanks for contacting Google SupportI really appreciate your effort to contact us and I also got the answer to our question When you buy a 2 year coverage for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and when it expires we cant extend the said subscription Plus you will get a 1 year warranty from us All in all you will have a 3year warranty However the 1 year warranty from us will not cover any accidental fall liquid on the phone or any physical damage In short we only cover any software issues on the phone such as wifi or carrier coverageEdit You can use google store credit on the two year plan but not on the monthly plan Considering buying a watch but I already have a pair of OG Pixel Buds that work fine so will have a good amount of credit left over","725":"My left earbud fell out of my ear and down a flight of stairs After this it would only produce static and then stop working a few seconds later I looked online for fixes and tried factory resetting it

message comes in it just beeps I had the iPhone and airpods and it automatically says who calling and reads out messages Im assuming from the setup the buds should do the same If anyone can help thank you in advance One last thing when using Duolingo there seems to be audio cutout when confirming a answer The button is pressed but sometimes there is audio and it cuts outor it doesnt play the sound

these with my Pixel Fold and trust me the sound is magic I normally hate Samsung and their products but this is as good as the AirPods pro for iPhone if not even better The only catch and stupid of Samsung is that these dont seem to pair across your Android devices automatically but it does pair across Samsung devices Ecosystem my foot But hey if you have a store nearby try it out This would be a huge improvement over pixel buds pro for sure ","729":"Greetings Today I have become an owner of the second generation of the pixel buds pro They work great and I paired them with my Pixel without

often talk about the same few things1 Android is clunky and hard to use2 Theres too much bloatware3 Theyre tired of ads and autoinstalling appsAfter using a Pixel for the first time though Ive come to realize this thing is just as polished as my iPhone was If not more If anything the above issues are almost exclusively Samsung issuesFor example1 ClunkinessAndroid for a long time now has allowed the user to use navigation gestures The average nontechy user prefers this and the average iPhone switcher definitely does too considering it operates the same way their iPhone didKeep in mind that most people typically never change the default settings Why then do Galaxy phones default to the clunky old 3 button navigation bar hiding the gesture bar under several deep menus The average consumer wants the gesture bar and so the Pixel and hell many other Android brands use it by default2 BloatwareIts simply a fact that Samsung ships way too many apps on their devices For almost every software service theres a good chance youll have three stock options the Google app you want to use the Samsung copy of that app you dont want to use and a Microsoft app on there for some unknown reason Google Photos Samsung Gallery Microsoft OneDrive WhyThe fact of the matter is when the average consumer uses a phone and opens a file they dont want to be bombarded with 3 different options They want that file or that action to just happen Seamlessly If they wanted OneDrive or Word or Samsung Internet theyd go download it3 Ads and autodownloadsBy default an unlocked Galaxy Aseries will autodownloads apps you never asked for occasionally It will also feed you ads in your notifications Whats worse is that carrierlocked S and Z phones the flagship Galaxy devices will still do this This is horrible for the user experience  one should NEVER have to deal with being served an ad by their very own operating system let alone forced to install applications This is why Windows 11 is getting so much hateCompare all of this to the Pixel Or really any stock Android phone The Pixels got a clean simple interface with one design language one ecosystem of apps a fluid and easy to navigate gesture system and zero inbuilt ads and autoinstallers This is what stock Android is unbloated by Samsung and One UI And its an amazing experienceAll these software issues the Galaxy series have are bad enough on their own However combining them with this one extra fact makes them significantly worseGalaxy phones outsell every other Android brand combined in the USThe average American consumer will buy an Android end up with a Galaxy and end up with an absolutely terrible user experience Whats next Theyre not buying a Pixel or a OnePlus Samsung defines an Android to them and Samsung failed their needsTheyre buying an iPhone afterward and never looking backiPhones have a 80 market share among young Americans And theyre growing The only competitor making a dent in that 20 is Samsung and their horrific user experience hemorrhages market share to Apple every quarterSamsungs strategy isnt working The iPhone is pushing them to a breaking point and the Pixel is growing in from the other side","736":"Posted in the Google Support forum may as well try here tooMy wife and I both have Pixel 9 phones We just arrived in the US from Canada for a vacation and are completely unable to connect our phones with Android Auto to rental cars We have tried 4 different rental cars 3 brands Ford Nissan and Dodge and BOTH of our phones We can pair our phones to the cars but Android Auto does NOT work  either over Bluetooth or wired My phone was connected via Android Auto to my BWM i4 at home before the Android 15 update and was still working afterwards My wife has a Tesla so her phone has never been used with Android Auto since the update or before I have tried over and over with Bluetooth on and off I just had to go and buy a windshield mount for our phones as we cant use the vehicle screens Not ideal when we spent so much on new phones Does ANYONE have a solution or any ideas I have tried resetting Bluetooth removing all connected Android Auto vehicles and trying again and again

and says AA is running but nothing happens on screen Any help is appreciated","739":"Ive been an Android user for over a decade with a string of Pixels in recent years My last iPhone was the iPhone 3 I think so its been a long time Ive always liked the flexibility of Android plus the fact that Googles ecosystem isnt closedmeaning in theory I could switch to iPhone at any time without too much hassleBut my Pixel 7 had been giving me headaches especially with Google Messages failing to receive texts in group chats I dont know if it was the phone or my carrier but after months of frustration I finally gave in Seeing the sheer number of iPhones around me plus the way Apple is constantly hyped up in media I figuredwhy not Maybe I was missing outSo a week ago I used an upgrade from my carrier to get the iPhone 16 Pro Here are my thoughts so far How I Use My PhoneI use my phone for both work and personal life and a lot of that involves typingemails messaging across multiple apps etc I rely on crossplatform apps like WhatsApp Gmail Outlook Salesforce and many Google services Google News Drive Keep Gmail Maps YouTube Music etc The Good Hardware Quality A really nice piece of hardware Beautiful solid and feels great in hand The Pro model is a good sizebig but not too bulky Screen Looks fantastic No complaints Camera  Video Takes excellent shots and from all accounts the video quality is toptier Dynamic Island First time hearing about it but its actually pretty cool Having sports scores and music controls right there is surprisingly useful Software Touches Some effects and animations are really smoothlike when scanning a document it isolates the background and seamlessly moves it into the corner CarPlay This surprised me When catching up on notifications it gives a naturallanguage summary of missed messages which is really nice    The Apple Maps navigation voice and style is very natural and smoothI actually prefer it to Google Maps I guess the days of being navigated into a lake are over for Apple Maps Grouped Notifications While I still think Android does notifications better Apples grouping and summarization of sameapp notifications is intelligently designed and useful FaceID When youre holding the phone FaceID works perfectlyfast and accurate However if the phone is sitting on a desk or table FaceID often wont pick up your face unless you awkwardly lean over it A fingerprint reader would be a really nice option in those situations Standby Mode Standby mode at night with the bedside alarm clock in red was actually very nice and welldesigned Its subtle but easy to read at night without being harsh on the eyes Also the default iPhone alarm tone is exceptionally pleasingway better than the jarring tones Im used to on Android GenMoji Seems Fun I didnt even try it once but I bet its cool for those who are into that sort of thing The BadThese arent new complaints about iOS but for someone using it as a main device they are massive hurdles The Keyboard is Borderline Unusable Whether using the stock keyboard or Gboard on iOS the experience is awful So many typos wrong key pressesits just bad The Gboard on my old Pixel 7 was 1000x more accurate and faster to type on It has been consistently infuriating I had no idea just how much better the Android keyboard was Notifications  Anxiety Machine iPhone is aggressive with notificationsway more than I was used to On Android you can easily choose which notifications for a given app should be silent or not right from the notification itselfjust a quick tap and done On iPhone its a much more laborious process requiring you to dig into settings manually for each app This makes it way harder to finetune notifications to be useful instead of overwhelming Speaking of Settings Why is there a whole app called Settings instead of just swiping down and tapping an icon to adjust things quickly Having to navigate through an app for simple things like WiFi or Bluetooth is an unnecessary step No App Drawer This is insane Instead of a clean app drawer you have to either search for apps which is fine but not intuitive or look through Apples premade categories in the App Library The grouping seems neat at first glance but ends up being a wild choice in actual use Why do I have to rely on Apple to decide where my apps go CarPlay Layout is a Mess Apple Maps is actually pretty solid nownaturalsounding navigation accurate directionsbut the overall CarPlay interface is clunky compared to Android Auto    If you use Google Maps on CarPlay without a car screen just on your phone you can only get inapp media controls for Spotify or Apple Musicnot YouTube Music Why iMessage is Seriously Underwhelming I was expecting more RCS on Android does the same thing minus the blue bubble exclusivity so the fact that Apple has built an entire bullying ecosystem around this feels ridiculous WhatsApp does all of this and works across devices    No iMessage on a PC This was a shock I use a PC for work and I was stunned to realize that iMessage has no web or Windows version With Google Messages WhatsApp or basically any other modern messaging platform I could just open a browser and continue conversations while working With iPhone Nope Either use a Mac or be stuck switching between my phone and computer constantly Transferring Old Messages From Android Was a Nightmare This was infuriating Theres no native way to do it so I had to try a thirdparty expensive appand even that still didnt work Homescreen Organization is a Disaster On Android I can place apps and widgets where I wantmaybe I have a family photo as my wallpaper and dont want anything covering faces On iPhone Move one app and the whole homescreen shifts like a chaotic game of Tetris If you try to put an app in a folder its like chasing a toddler at bedtime Just why Final Verdict For NowAll of my complaints seem like they should be obvious to anyone who uses a phone regularly and heavily The keyboard alone makes the iPhone unusable for anyone who has used a functional mobile keyboard before The homescreen mess the notifications anxiety and the lack of a proper back gesture all add up to an experience that feels polished but deeply inefficientSo it appears Ill be switching back to Androidand a Pixel 9 Pro Im sure Ill still have complaints and yeah I know some grown adults will keep whining about green bubbles But whatever I need to get stuff doneWould love to hear from others who made the switch either way Did you stick with it or go back Does anybody ever switch any

switching from iPhone to pixel and back to iPhone I feel like I didnt give it enough time to grow on me since I ended up going back only after 7 days Hear me out and see below the  pros and cons based on my 7 days ownershipPros 1 Love love love the design Is sick2 The camera is on a different level for sure Amazing picture taking3 Android autoplay like it a bit better than apple carplay since it is more customizable Example you can have notification taken off from popping up on the car screen However to silent them you cant do it through The pixel you need to go through the auto play in the car Cons1 Picture by picture videos dont have the rewind or forward tabs on it unless you do a double screen2 The back gesture is sometimes annoying when pressing to go back Has to be a hard press3 I find that the notes app for google is pretty trash Very unorganized4 Face id at night is a no go and also when youre wearing sunglasses5 When a viewing a picture or video you cant just swiped off it you have to X it out of it 6 I feel like the battery doesnt last as much as an iPhone7 The camera lenses when zooming in and out is very very laggyTo conclude I know all the cons sound like annoyance of mines and since Ive been using an iPhone since 2008  and I should had probably given the pixel more than just 7 days Hope this helps anyone on the fence to switching The pixel is a great phone just not for me  at the moment ","743":"","744":"Hey all Just downgraded to a pixel 6 and I havent been able to get android auto running in my car mazda3 2023 It worked just fine with my iPhone also Ive

When I went to get a cover cafe to get tempered glass from nearby mall the salespeople there held the phone and said its very cute and feels really good It feels premium and compact and you are gonna love it Speaking of tempered glass tho It does NOT come out with a thin film installed on it either and the device being new getting tempered glass is difficult Although I have not seen scratches yet I wont get peace of mind until I get a tempered glass Also the hard plastic back cover feels good to hold but its so tight that I am sure when a tempered glass is installed it will break that from sides These are minor nitpicks Otherwise build quality is amazing Very Bright display too Almost too bright indoors Has HDR10 and HDR10 supportDisplay  Gorgeous 15k by default and no option to switch to 1080p but I dont care Its just that option would have been better in case want to save more battery But the display is sharp For color profile modes Natural is too muted and vivid is too vivid So in between them radiant should be a great middle ground One thing I noticed is that both natural and radiant are warmyellowish tint color calibrated whereas vivid is cooler color calibratedColor modes Vivid has cooler tone and Natural Radiant have warmer tonehttpspreviewreddit30jjo6xqz8rd1jpgwidth1200formatpjpgautowebps4b59854761973b182591d3bc77d7541c5c086b8aIt has LTPO Reviewers in YouTube say that if you leave it in auto it will dial back on its own and save battery and 120 option means always 120 That is not true I found auto option to be very finicky It has a sudden jerk while scrolling and stopping and dialing down of refresh rate is very aggresive in auto so I switched to 120 and thank God its smoother and it infact does dial down to 1 pretty regularly like auto but not aggressively I would recommend leaving it on 120 rather than Auto the LTPO still works on 120 optionRefresh

specific app so It was extremely easy to changeSo Now that you have the backstory heres the things I dislike or miss1 A native music player like Samsung Music is missing but luckily I found a good music player that read all my 2000 songs2 A native photo  video gallery with decent features Google photos is great to store and search images but lacking my most used feature of Samsung Gallery  Press and hold anywhere on an image and it attempts to auto select what you pointed at and if selected properly you could save it as a new image or copy  share it directly3  The Pixel Camera app doesnt allow me to control exposure just by holding somewhere to focus and then lowering it like Apple or Samsung Camera app and I havent found a way to do itThats it I dont regret my change but of course Im a little sad for having these basic things missing Other than that its a great phone","748":"I just gotta come here and express my gratitude towards Google for actually fixing and changing the many issues with their previous devices To preface Ive been a long time iPhone user who dabbles with the android ecosystem I used to flipflop back and forth each year between Apple and Google up until the Pixel 4 but then I felt like googles devices couldnt keep up with some of the hardware Apple uses on their devices Most recently I really tried to love the P8P but there was so many issues I couldnt see past that would degrade the experience of the device As with my job I cant really be near a charger at all times one of my main issues was the terrible battery life of the Pixel 8 Pro I wouldnt even make it through an 810 hour shift comfortably with the Pixel 8 Pro And it wasnt solely for screen on time but mainly standby time that was the culprit Of course screen time would degrade my battery life even quicker but as it was in my pocket for a few hours and Id go back onto my phone seeing that it lost 15 percent battery life was extremely unsettling Id constantly limit background usage turn 5G off an use LTE strictly turn off location services And although that helped slightly I dont believe you should limit your phone in a bunch of different ways to be able to prolong battery lifeI always also experienced laggingstuttering issues with the 8 Pro This issue is self explanatory and not much to say other than it seriously degraded the experience of using the phoneOverheating Yeah that was an issue constantly Id be using maps on my car and my phone would have an overheating warning In direct sunlight Id have an overheating warning Etc it was just a constant battle The modem on the 8 Pro was AWFUL Such spotty service dropped calls and again limiting to LTE instead of 5G just to have improvements on the battery life Now with the P9PXL oh my what a drastic difference And of course this is my experience with the device but battery has been amazing The standby times have been excellent no need to limit background usage limit to LTE turn down screen resolution Yesterday I had over 4 hours SOT and the device was still at 50 ish percent battery life by the time I got home I was using the camera maps daily texting phone calls emails social media and this device just handled it so well The modem is crazy good Id argue better than apples I live in the basement of my house and on either the 8 Pro or 15 Pro Max Id get one bar or no bars in my room P9PXL is sitting at 3 bars right now in a room I struggled to have service in Havent experienced a single dropped call using 5G and this modem is killing it allOverheating hasnt been an issue at all This phone remains cool with my usage patterns because of that new vapor chamber Havent had a single overheating issue whether using android auto or just being outside on my deviceStuttering hasnt been an issue at all The UI has been buttery smooth No hiccups or stuttering The new fingerprint sensor works flawlessly Im using a tempered glass screen protector and it just reads my fingerprint without delay Messing around with the add me feature on the camera and the magic eraser its just crazy what AI on a device can do Some of the features are a gimmick in my opinion but some of these features are seriously QOL features With RCS finally available on iPhone well currently to those who have the iOS 18 beta texting between iPhone and Android has been lovely with those read receipts reply features no horribly compressed photosvideos I say this with full confidence but I genuinely feel like this is finally a Pixel year for me Im seriously loving everything about this phone ","749":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here Thought Id share my experience after almost 8 months of ownershipP8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release I use it with 5G on screen at full resolution dynamic smooth display refresh rate is on no bluetooth or tethering Brightness left on autoTLDR  Positives  Camera quality great design  display OS with some caveats  Negatives  everything elseThe positives Camera  beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line and this release is no exception Every shot has this mesmerizing Pixel touch and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit Videos are world class too not quite on the level of the iPhone but well get there eventuallyBeautiful and unique design  Its sitting in a clear case and in a sea of generic boring slabs it really stands out and doesnt go unnoticed People often ask me what kind of phone it is most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade nowVery long software support  Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene albeit with the following youll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years so its not really a positiveWorld class display  stellar QHD 120hz panel sharp and brightSleek OS  Android in its purest cleanest form Customization galore However as Ill mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly so I dont know if this count as a positive Now onto the negativesFirst off we must address the elephant in the room Battery life This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast The opposite of what you want right The 10 minutes top ups to 50 is a concept Google seemingly never heard ofYou want half a charge  Better sit  wait half an hour Full charge  Go watch a movie  Now the discharge and this is where the real drama clocks in This phone EATS battery ON IDLEOn your average 9 to 5 workday no camera no games just basic apps youll head home with 15 tops Phone dead by 7pm then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule better not be in a hurryNow try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone  A bit of pictures for work at 10am a short 4K video at 1pm a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm Youre now looking at a 4pm shutdownBut lets go real on the camera after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day Starting at 10 am  pictures videos a bit of editing about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each Shutdown at 1PMThe CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING Throw anything heavy at it and youll head home with a dead phone one that died long before your day was over Simple as thatKeep in mind that this is my experience with a 8monthsold device and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software supportNow we need to talk UI and animations because this isnt good either Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness but not here Actually some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz Switching apps isnt 120hz either nor is scrolling A TON of lags and various frame drops resulting in a framerate like 4090hz never stable with the occasional but very rare peak at 120 This isnt TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023 1159 flagship phone from GoogleThis phone FEELS slow and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so InfuriatingOne day I had to handle a coworkers A54 to tweak a few things I was SHOCKED by the smoothness this was indeed true 120hz which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos midranger I understand the need for a dynamic framerate not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasnt what I had in mindFinally the optical underdisplay fingerprint scanner This my friends is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018  One of the first phones with UDFS The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable still is most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device just in case Well this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro and no optical sensor backup in sightSometimes it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact tosuccessfully fail to unlock After it fails 3 times or so it will ask you to enter your password making onehand unlocks a luck job Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI As for faceunlock I know its there but I disabled it because it doesnt work in the dark no IR sensor and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height without having to raise it to my facePixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis And indeed it does look incredibly cool I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone but Id rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159TLDR  Positives  Camera quality great design  Negatives  everything else","750":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel Ive noticed several areas where Pixel excels Heres my breakdown\u00a0 Edit Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom due to community rules 1 Advanced Notification System Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and current playback in the notification center notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful Intuitive notification management eg disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app\u00a0 2 Clear Interactive System Information Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone Alarm volume feedback when you miss an alarm it shows you that volume of your alarm is low Reminder to close Incognito pages after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on\u00a0 3 Robust File Management PClike file system with enhanced filtering All your documents from whatever app you use you will find it in the documents tap Same for images Its universal same as the PC Because files controls all Its better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0 4 Enhanced User Interface Google search bar on home screen and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS Maybe because its older feature so Its much adopted You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and Im addicted to it right now Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for nonnative English speakers\u00a0 5 Multimedia and Connectivity More practical PictureinPicture PiP functionality Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay especially for web pages and not so popular website Specially in background continuity of the casting You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet\u00a0 6 Communication Features Full call history logs Easy one here iPhone \u00a0 7 Customization and Productivity Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature Specially you can pin you copies for ever The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it In this way you will have bigger windows but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as its on chrome browser on windows Its fast accurate and never disappoint you Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons\u00a0 8 App Availability I dont why but Android in general have collection of not wellknown apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use For example in Android in IPTV 9stream You cannot find similar app on iPhone Downloading apps from outside the Play store gives you the freedom you have on windows\u00a0 9 Device Analysis Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights Part 2 why iOS in some parts outperform Android PixelNow the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel 1 Better Face UnlockiOSs Face ID is still the best in class Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure For example it cannot verify your wallet payment 2 Unified Call HistoryHaving all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important I know some users hate this feature but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work 3 Spotlight SearchSpotlight search is the Feature No 1 that I wish android has One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device even files documents photos For example if you swipe down and type passport iOS will give you the passport document in Files app in addition to the Passport screenshots photos in your Photos app 4 Text Cursor ControlHold space to move the cursor making text editing easier Better than the one in Gboard 5 Privacy in TrackingBetter control and transparency over app tracking 6 VPN in SafariBuiltin VPN support while Google Ones VPN isnt available in my country 7BestinClass AccessoriesAir Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone  For example If I wear the AirPods while Im watching Youtube in the Apple TV notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone neat featureAlso you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone 8 Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight 9CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay Carplay is far more stable and reliable I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado and I never having it disconnected from the car In Android two three times a week 10Touch Screen QualityI dont why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel Its more accurate and shorter response time 11 Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devicesThis is an important point Document folder in iOS iCloud is the same on all Apple devices So without uploading or backing up files If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device 12Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also 13 Stable and Polished AppsAndroid has made good leap on this part but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts 14iMessage and FacetimeFor me Facetime is really handy iMessage are major for the users in US For us here we use WhatsApp mainlywe reach the end I hope  its helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons","751":"Ive had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years got it in 2021 Very happy with it I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area Despite being very happy with the 4a I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a I decided to go for that instead Here are my observations so far THIS PHONE IS BIG On paperhttpsiimgurcomHzp3HbIpng the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size The 8a is bigger but it is not considered to be a big phonehttpsiimgurcommdAphoEpng nowadays In reality there is a very noticeable size difference The 8a feels huge Not only is it noticeably taller and wider but it is tangibly heavier too This phone is HEAVY My 4a in its case is 184g and the 8a is 237g You can feel those 53 grams They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either Bezels galore It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size This is not a one handed use phone at least not comfortably THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH If you dont know the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling you can Google it there are plenty of reports from users I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz Side note Pixel 9 also stutters 9 Pro  9 Pro XL are smooth And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15 it is in fact not fixed I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth It is incredibly smooth This is how 120Hz should look and feel Once you try out the 120Hz mode 60Hz looks terrible I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz the downgrade is immediately noticeable I only noticed stuttering with 9gag the app stutters in any mode but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade or going into settings It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings The screen is great THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR HOW I LAMENT THOUThe 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor It was a Pixel line signature feature Super convenient and worked reliably Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8aUPDATE It is awful and unusable Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock BATTERY The 8a is new so the battery life is great But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life Ive had two 4a Pixels the first one had decent battery life the second one though drains very quickly for some reason I have to charge it several times a day so a better battery is very welcome Charging is slow on the 8a but to me it really does not matter The 4a charged slowly too and it did not bother me much After trying it a bit more the 8a is better than the 4a but it is not as great as I thought it would be Not a full day battery life phone you will need to change it at least once throughout the day Here is an example of the battery drain overnight Started with 80 batteryhttpsipostimgccMxzkX26pIMG20241210000007jpg Dropped to 67 overnighthttpsipostimgccZZHGd7nFIMG20241210100123jpg The conditions here Connectivity through LTE all the apps closed the screen was off the whole time I missed the alarm maybe that took one or two percent If we account for that it is 1112 drop overnight A FLAGSHIP SOC WHO NEEDS IT I never had any complaints with the 4as speed and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I dont play games The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC To be honest though I dont notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a Both open apps browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite THE RAM The 4a has 6GB of RAM the 8a has 8GB of RAM Have I noticed any improvements in daytoday use Absolutely not Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memoryTHE ROBOT I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them I dont care if a feature is big or small I only care about how useful it is For example manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature but I love it It make a big difference for me The 8a came with Android 14 I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15 There are some good features like  Circletosearch is cool  Although I thought Id be using it all the time I havent used it once so far Private space is nice  A good feature to have Havent had the need for it yet I like the new back icon its animation how it snaps off from the edge  Predictive back gesture animation is great  I think if this animation is used then the above back icon animation is unnecessary Right now its the two of them at once Pin autoconfirm is good to have very handy with the new finger print sensor  Ive used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isnt great USBC to monitor video streaming is good  Havent used it yet  There is partial screen recording  Havent had the need for it yet but good to have The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80 charge limit  I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options which I dont really use but overall I dont feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all This is a bit of a different topic but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23 That has killed a few good apps that I used It and Pixel 8a also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely This change me made look over the apps I use and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available Made me want to stick to Android 13 Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a does not work anymore Disappointing In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky You can swipe any notification away I used a network speed monitor Network Speedhttpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomevozinetwork and a todo list app NotifyMehttpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomkilaaddnotificationlars that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident It was so convenient Not sure why they changed that Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it LIGHTS CAMERA ACTION I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade at best Its all probably due to the higher resolution So far the 8a is a bit warmer and resolves just a tiny almost unnoticeable amount of detail The camera app is alright but yet again it really lacks pro options I wonder if its developers are into photography at all At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values but those settings reset and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session The reason you want to lock them is because Pixels white balance is all over the place depending on the angle Two photos taken within seconds of each other just at a different angle with auto white balancehttpsipostimgccPt9wMz4wScreenshot20230715115403jpg I still consider Nokia Lumias camera apphttpswwwwindowslatestcomwpcontentuploads201710WindowsCamerajpg to be superior I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential It can take nicer shots There is no Camera PX for the 8a Here is an example of I dont care what gcam app you use just squeeze out the best this phone can do handheld The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right Fan  Low lighthttpsipostimgccKmFCHT594avs8a202412021jpg  The 4a has more grain and that radiation texture at 100 resolution but it is sharper focused and has more details The moment you downsize it it looks noticeably betterFan  Realistic low lighthttpsipostimgccfDY6CCYt4avs8a202412022jpg  Again the 4a is better Close up focus is not good on the 8a The 4a focuses closer and its photos are sharper even when 2x magnification is used The 8as camera makes everything BRIGHT In automatic mode it turns night into a day The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera but I feel like its pretty useless At least I havent had a need for it And when I tried the quality is rather poor Would have preferred a 2x telephoto UPDATE I have used the ultrawide several times now and I really started appreciating its usefulness especially with video But the quality is poor Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8ahttpspostimgccgallery9z9tbdM Ill add some more photos as I goI absolutely hated video quality on the 4a I feel like it took horrendous 4K video They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter and it just looked awfulhttpsimgurcomapixel4avideoqualitySaKfzup I actually preferred the OG Pixels 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a which was ok still not great but not as bad as the 4K mode The 8as video is better both 1080p and 4k It looks pretty good to me Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times It is something a few YouTube reviewers have mentioned beforehttpsyoutubeACIqHX9SpUwt595 Hopefully it gets improved in the future The 8as LED light is weaker the 4as is noticeably brighter HAPTICS Haptics are different I feel like the 4a has more punch It hits more noticeably maybe because its smaller The 8as haptics feel more internal somehow Going from the OG Pixels vibration motor to the 4as haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics It was a totally new better experience Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics Havent tried those extensively though CONNECTIVITY The cell reception is good have not noticed any issues or had any complaints Never had any complaints with 4a either The GNSS reception is excellenthttpsipostimgccrcYKkWBqGPSData2024121102png The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m The 8a gets down to 2mhttpsipostimgcc1Pzf2MYWGPSData2024121101jpg Picks up GPS GLONASS Galileo BeiDou all of them256GB PLEASE The model that was available to me was the 128GB one I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a 256GB would be a welcome upgrade but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option 256GB should be the minimum storage THE REST Speakers are louder than the 4a Clearer Not certain about that one But louder for sure An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a As soon as I inserted it I received a SIM not supported message Apparently newer Pixels require the Class C 18V sim card Ive ordered a replacement SIM I really hope that fixes it UPDATE That fixed it So if you are getting the SIM not supported message get a new Class C 18V replacement from your carrier You probably dont need to specify the class to them just a replacement it should be the new type that will be compatible Havent tried 5G at all I do not need it The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB TypeC which was introduced in Android 13 but the 4a did not have the drivers for it Transferring things is tedious I havent found a way to move eSIMs over IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13 the X7 Ultra the vivo X100 Ultra I dont know about that now After trying the 8a I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra which is the same size as the OnePlus and others I have no idea how people manage that Those phones are gigantic Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone but when the time comes they buy the bigger one I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version I would love a 58 Pixel again but with tiny bezels like on the Galaxy S24 Or even better a 55 120Hz screen with tiny bezelshttpsipostimgccjj3QfQfXS244a4amini13minipng Going back to the 4as 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly and the phone is such a joy to use I love its size THE FOLLOW UPI dont know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a I love the 120Hz smoothness and yes I can yet again confirm unlike the Pixel 8 the 8a is smooth But the phone is big and heavy I dont really know what I upgraded The camera is the same a bit worse in certain areas the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all 4G is enough for me the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it and it works well and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without 80 charge limit is good but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as its the same size as the 8a and it has a telephoto lens or maybe the S25 The XLPlus phones are not for me The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera akin to the legendary Nokia 808 PureViewhttpspostimgccgallery49dptV5 when it came outHere are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for youhttpspostimgccgallerywyPM7qG All photos shot on Lumia 950","752":"Hey everyone I wanted to share my full and honest experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL This might be a long post but I hope it gives valuable insight especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S This is my very first experience with a Pixel and Android in general Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XLI usually upgrade my phone every two years but this year the iPhone 16 Pro Max didnt feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Maxat least not enough to justify the cost So I decided to finally give Android a shot and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience the Pixel lineup Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel The CameraIm a professional photographer and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use This time I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my goto mobile photography device Unfortunately Ive been quite disappointed due to several software restrictionsespecially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app Ive made a separate post about this issue Software Experience Just Good But Not ExceptionalThe Android experience on the Pixel is fineit gets the job done But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily lifeSome features I really liked The ability to longpress the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen The automatic song recognition feature which detects music playing around me Gemini AI is promising but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands Fingerprint and Face Unlock Fingerprint Sensor Excellent Works fast and reliably with no issues Face Unlock Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead I dont have anything covering the camera or affecting it yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful Camera My Biggest DisappointmentDespite the Pixels strong reputation for mobile photography my experience has been frustrating The camera is great only in excellent lighting conditions and mainly for still photos Issues I Faced1 Excessive smoothing and processing  Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing even in RAW When I open RAW files in Lightroom they appear overly soft and lose critical details2 Depth of field issues  The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus and even AI adjustments cant fully correct it3 Limitations on thirdparty apps  8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app Thirdparty apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos which is frustrating for professional use4 Lens switching in video mode is terrible  When switching between lenses while recording theres an obvious cut and disruption making transitions very unprofessional The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality5 Auto white balance is unreliable  It constantly shifts in realtime while recording forcing me to set it manually every time6 Portrait mode looks artificial  The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural7 Lowlight performance is extremely poor  Even with Night Sight the results are disappointing If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode the results improve slightly but they are still far from what I expectedMost of these issues werent present on my iPhone even though Ive gone through every setting and tried full manual controls No matter what I change the postprocessing ruins my shots This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone App Store  Software EcosystemI also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple In theory Android apps should be cheaper not more expensive Additionally app quality feels more inconsistentmany apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily UseI want to be clear Im not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel In fact I want to switch and Ive been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone But after three months of daily use the experience hasnt lived up to my expectationsIm genuinely wondering Am I missing something Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues Is there any way to improve the bad image processing Has anyone found a fix for thirdparty camera limitationsI always keep my software and apps updated but nothing has improved these issues so far Id love to hear your thoughts and inputespecially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel Is there something Im overlookingEdit 1  More context I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the\u00a0Pixel 9 Pro XL specifically regarding\u00a0RAW photo processingIve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in\u00a0Lightroomthey look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos Theres a\u00a0huge loss of detail aggressive noise reduction and softening making the RAW files almost unusable for proper editingIve attached\u00a0two images of the same RAW file\u00a0to show what I mean\u00a0Comparison Images  httpsimgurcomaBdOOOtyhttpsimgurcomaBdOOOty1\u00a0First image\u00a0 RAW viewed in Google Photos looks relatively fine  2\u00a0Second image\u00a0 The exact same RAW file opened in Lightroom before any edits The Issue When opening the RAW file in\u00a0Lightroom it looks\u00a0significantly worse with\u00a0excessive smoothing and loss of sharpness This happens\u00a0before applying any adjustments so its not an issue with my editing It feels like\u00a0Google is still applying some kind of processing or compression to RAW files which defeats the purpose of shooting RAW in the first place Questions Is this a known issue with Pixel RAW processing Is there a way to get true unprocessed RAW files for editing Anyone else experiencing this with Lightroom or other editing appsId really appreciate any input from other Pixel users especially photographers I want to get the most out of this camera but this has been a frustrating limitation Let me know if you have any insights  ","753":"My partner has a Pixel 4a which we purchased for her shortly after its launch a few years ago The phone used to take great albeit very Pixelesque photos with minimal effortHowever over the past two years and a series of updates the quality of the Pixel Camera app appears to have deteriorated drastically to where any picture you take in conditions where theres a contrast in lighting or colour is overprocessed and homogenised until it looks utterly soulless Its the Pixelesque thing multiplied by tenThis morning I finally took the time to draw a comparison between the stock Pixel Camera app and a BSG Google Camera

stick to this GCam port instead going forwardFor context in the GCam port Google AWB was turned on as was Auto HDRalthough the Ultra HDR or whatever that maximumHDR option is called these days was turned off That seemed to give us the best results","754":"I have seen a lot of bad reviewscomplaints about pixel phones and I thought I would share my mostly positive experiences I bought my phone in 2021 and Ive had an overall great experience Pros fast and responsiveeasily share filescellular and data connection always greatmultiple users worked seamlesslyphotos and photo editing are good my wifes Samsung seems to take better quality videos though Bluetooth connection to multiple devices easily battery life adequate for my needs  Obviously its not a perfect phone some cons Android 14 update fiasco couldnt save files couldnt take photos for about 10 days Android auto glitches occasionally calls wouldnt connect to the car audio but it must have been fixed since it hasnt happened in a few months I miss the Pixel 5 back pingerprint sensorwhen a phone call or notification interrupts playing music on phone not connected to Bluetooth it turns down the music volume after the notification  Considering all this I still enjoyed the past 3 years with my phone Im interested in anyone elses Pixel 6 experiences whether positive or negative ","755":"Ive seen some posts that the battery life is ruined on their Pixel 4a due to the recent update Same happened to meGood news is you can go back to the previous version here are some instructions for thatto go back to the previous version go to httpsdevelopersgooglecomandroidimagesand search for the Pixel 4a images you can choose the date and the version you want to go back to Nov 2023 was the last update before the latest and then select the flash option Make sure youre using Google Chrome and make sure you have developer settings turned on on your device with USB debugging and OEM unlocking turned on as wellnow it will redirect you to flashandroidcom they will need you to plug in your phone to your computer and then you can start the flash process and wait for it to complete the image is about 2 gigabytes and then the flash process will start keep in mind your data will be wiped out Make sure to back up everything firstafter flashing turn on developer options and then turn off the option Automatic System Updatesthis will prevent from auto updating again to the latest version Hope this helps someoneUpdate You cannot get the 4a factory images anymore They are removed unfortunately

after 3 days Changed as was bored with IPhones and iOS Been using them constantly since IPhone 3GS Been a good ride Now change has come Apple does make some good products Havent changed phones since 10 XS Max as Ive been waiting for that damn island to disappear 16 was the straw Also not a fan of apple rebranding everything to their liking apple intelligence and their hypocritical sales policy Youre not a force for good youre just like most companies in it for the money stop pretending Always been in the garden but never ever a fan boy Being a fan boygirl for technology is ridiculous Be a fan of peace politeness and respect and good things like good food good weather good times and  good tech regardless of the brand  Love the box Minimal and eminently recyclable I know it costs them peanuts but still its a gorgeous minimalist eco design Better than the shoeboxes from before All you need I look at and use my phone not the boxcasing If a lack of wall charger or earbuds surprises you nowadays youre in for a hard lifeLighter than my 10 XS Max Most phones probably are nowadays Form reminds me of a cross between iPhone 6 S Plus Max cant remember and iPhone 5 for some reason but they were my personal fave iPhones Definitely a beauty Rocking the silicone google case Simplicity Plus have insurance so not worried about crippling drops Set upmoving across was a breeze Used a cable Took about an hourDont mind redoing all my passwords like keychain or 1 Password Gotta delete a lot So an excuse to spring clean Disappointed with subscription 1Password bought a premium account twice a while ago Bitwarden seems to be working fine Also no heating issues at all Phone temperature stayed ambient like the room Even everyday usage doesnt heat it at all But then I dont game or watch filmsseries on it thats what the Sony UHD and PS5 is for I do watch a few Premier League matches a day though on the weekends Bonus Sony uses Android TV so I can control and talk to my TV What a world we live in Scary And good Keyboard is noiiiice Love the haptic feedback without clicks As I have stubby thumbsfingers like pigs tits typing seems to be pleasurable again Had to retype everything on iPhone although my fault shouldve used swipe to type But the predictive text and auto correct seem supremely better I was getting some crazy nonsensical bullshit recently on the iphone Love the numbers at the top of the keyboard permanently And the very quick acces to multiple punctuation marks The one thing missing from ios is the spacebar to move the cursor anywhere not just one line at a time Still not a massive deal Or even a small one Im sure an app may solve it Like jailbreaking Ill live and learn Usage is easy to get used to Swipe gestures are like ios The universal back is a god send Love the simplicity and logic behind usage Although such in depth settings too And deep search within settings Gobsmacked Battery life has been stellar All day 0700  midnight use with 30 left at night 9 hours screen time And Im constantly playing with it and editing photos Which brings me to the camera One of the main reasons for getting this phone Its amazing Does all I want and the quality is crazy good  The built in ai is mind boggling and fun So easy to use especially with the pixel tips app Macro and astrophotography in one bundle count me in The zoom is excellent especially for a phone Add Me is surprisingly useful and a blast especially when adding 2 of the same person Magic Eraser is also useful bettermore convenient than using another app Also changing backgrounds is astoundingly good Portait is also not too bad when you adjust the blur manually The pan and long exposure is fantastic especially on a phone Havent tried much else such as video No bluetooth problems No connection issues at all One of the best things The monochromenight mode Absolutely love it Like I get a new phone each night And the always on lock screen What have I been doing in life to miss out on these thingsGemini is fun too Better than I thought and it does all my tasks easily includung Hue lights TV disappointing but true prognosis for my teams prospects and even opening and playing a song from Apple Music for the lossless still use wired speakers earbuds Plus quickfire questions to prove my kids wrong and that dad knows all Only things missing the spacebar see above the bottom address bar in Chrome and the tap to scroll up know I can get it with Touch the Notch Really not much at all considering the enjoyment and upgrades it brings Absolutely no regrets at all Love it Managed to get Pixel Screenshots and Pixel Studio working even though I live in France Well done APK mirror and side loading not achievable on iphone unless jail broken which I used to do a bit of to get Android features Maybe because my account was originally set up in the UK and I use US English on the phone Who knows They just work Overall a highly recommend phone coming from a 5 year old iphone But highly recommend just the same Magnificent piece of technology hardware os and cloud Maybe Ill be back in a month complaining but I highly doubt it I hope If anyone wants more indepth details or has questions ask away Remember a brief review after just 3 days use coming from iphone","757":"Please tell me Im not the only one facing issues with my pixel all of the radio connectivity is just a joke LTE5G reception seems fine but internet just worksdoesnt work randomly  Bluetooth reception is a joke  my watch which Ive been using without any problems with Iphone 13 disconnects randomly with an obstruction of my own body same goes with headphones wireless android auto is a joke in that phone  whether its Bluetooth or wifi problem  phone in a pocket wont connect to ANdroid Auto at all or just outputs choppy audio and screen mirroring When phone is laying somewhere in the car near the radio  the problem dissapears  also an issue absent with iphone 13 using this phone for more than a 5 minutes warms it up so badly it often tells me to cool it of in warmer weathers Connected to android auto the phone gets so hot I cant operate it properly as it throttles and screen becomes unresponsive  battery drops really quick  also an issue with radio I guess  on the wifi it behaves pretty good but on LTE5G battery drops like 10 in few minutes charging is so freaking slow while using more demanding apps like streaming apps phone becomes choppy and unresponsive  when it goes into PIP mode you have to shut down the app to even read a message  crashes chrome restarts freezes etcIm on my last breath  Im thinking about switching to S23 or S24 ","758":"Ive been on Pixel since the 6 pro now have a 7 pro coming from the OnePlus 7 the main thing I wanted was the best android software experience At a first glance it seems great the features are amazing it doesnt bombard you with 50 different ways to do a task and the UI is clean with nearly 0 bloat just like Oxygen OS once wasThen come the bugs I expected it with the Pixel 6 new chip I thought they would be gone in a few months but they werent Eventually that phone decided to get a green line on the screen and insurance replaced it with a P7P surely this would be betterNo This phone has constantly had bugs from day 1 with android 13 all the way up to the current Android 15 Whenever 1 was fixed 2 more would just show up in their place app switcher not working the flashlight not turning on my camera app refusing to open or Gemini the failed experiment that made my smart home practically useless and made me miss work in the morning because I couldnt voice set my alarm or most recently and probably the worst my phone randomly and only partially in the notification tray and notifications switching to German I have never put German on this phone and the keyboard not coming upThe chip is garbage I understand its 2 years old but the g4 only performa 1020 percent better than this I cant even play uno or Minecraft on this phone without it lagging I can feel when my images are autouploadong from my phone grinding to a halt Battery life is also worse but Ill chalk that up to a 2 year old batteryThe only problem I havent had that people have been telling me is a problem is service mine works great in my area And when the software works its amazing to use but 50 percent of the time it just doesnt I miss the days of OnePlus and good Oxygen OSAtt is offering 1000 for this phone on the S25U first Samsung phone for me and Im taking it I really wanted to believe in your mission Google but I just cant handle it anymore I cant even recommend this phone what happened to Pixel being the iPhone of the android world Bring the tensor chip back into contention and dont make your users beta testers and Im sure that people will come flocking back to pixel Ill be waitingThoughts anyone have other issues or find a better phone to switch too","759":"Long time NexusPixel user Ive never really used Bluetooth devices much until the last few years when I got the OG Pixel buds and then later on the Pixel watch Other than that its usually only for Android AutoAnd ever since Ive been struggling to understand the logic with some of the Bluetooth device behavior when using them with Pixel phones1 When making a call with any Bluetooth device connected It always switches to that device when the other person answers the phoneFor example Ill be making a call with my phone connected to a Bluetooth speaker or Android Auto But I want to use the built in phone ear speaker instead for privacy or whatever So while the phone is ringing I switch to the phone ear speaker but as soon as the other person picks up it would switch back to the Bluetooth deviceThis is completely unrelated to any safety feature for Android Auto which was my initial thought when I didnt have any Bluetooth accessories It happens with my Sony ear buds my Pixel watch my gaming headphones etcIf I switch to a different speaker while making a call I expect it to remain until the call is overIts gotten to the point of me disabling the Pixel watch as a Bluetooth speaker because it makes it worse even when I dont have any other Bluetooth devices connected2 Why do I need 4 actions to disconnect from a device Sometimes more when the phone is locked We need a simple toggle next to all the connected devices in the quick tile menu instead of the gear icon that takes us to the Bluetooth settings pageMy phone is rooted but I cant seem to find any mods to help with these other than flashing a different romIts been a few years now and for simple bugs google sure is taking its sweet time to fix it If anything it seems to be getting worse","760":"Hello EveryoneYesterday I received the Android 15 update on my Pixel 6 pro however today I started noticing that people arent able to hear me when I talk I am able to hear the other person thou but they cant hear meThe issue gets temporarily fixed as soon as I reboot the phone After a few calls the issue starts happening again  Has this occurred to anyone","761":"UPDATE Its the OSlevel mic and possibly camera access When these are turned OFF blocked the audio doesnt play Turning them back on again solves the issue I can also start AA with the mic on play media and then block access again and it seems fine This is so stupid I prefer to keep these blocked until I need them and it has not been an issue for a year until nowTLDR\u00a0Been using my Pixel 8 Pro with VW Atlas for about a year no issues After updating to Android 15 AA connects and displays but all media is inaudibleIve been using AA with my Pixel 8 Pro and VW Atlas for about a year but I recently updated to Android 15 or the latest version of it and now when I get in the car everything connects maps and apps are displayed and media is shown as playing but no audio comes out I believe system sounds like Google Assistant voice are also not playingPodcast and music apps play and media progresses but no audio is heard And when I look at the phone it says that media is playing on This Phone with no other audio devices available despite being connected to the carWhats weird is that it will fix itself and work totally normally then I will leave the car for 5 minutes and return and the audio is gone again Then it will randomly come back in the futureThings I have tried from searching here and other forums Rebooting the phone Rebooting the VW head Turning BT on and off again Uninstalling and reinstalling Android AutoNo luck with anything Im at a loss here as I basically have no way to listen to anything in the car nowThanks for any advice","762":"First Ive been using Pixel phones since the Pixel 3  Still have it and several models in between  Most recently I used the Pixel 8 for a few years  I did have a lot of battery problems and I personally replaced the battery 3 times in it  So my Pixel 8 experience wasnt trouble free  But Im 2 weeks in to using my new Pixel 9 Pro p9p  and I cant say I like it  at all  Im just crossing my fingers that these problems get addressed and refined with updates to Android as I saw similar but smaller scale issues on my Pixel 8 p8 get better and better over time  Curious what all of your experiences with a Pixel 9 compared to older PIxel platforms isproblems Battery capacity SUCKS on p9p charge it in morning by bedtime its at 40  to 50 and then 10 in the morning I have switched graphics resolution to crappy version but really the point to a new phone is its better and I shouldnt have to run it in a hobbled mode to extend the battery a couple of hours P8 I could go 2 full days between charges  same exact application payloads and usage patterns with a screen protector  it is COMPLETELY unusable via the touch input  surface  even after fiddling with the sensitivity settings specifically for screen protectors  I had to rip off my screen protector to even get to the PIN input because fingerprint auth and low light facial both failed Its weirdly slippery  Ive watched my phone literally slide off of surfaces screen side down that had even the tiniest of tilt to it  resolved of course with a properdecent case  but insanely slippery without one Screen responsetouch input is horrible  Sometimes I have to try touching something 2 or 3 times before it responds Finger print reader is absolute crap on p9p  on my p8 it worked perfectly flawlessly for me Text to Speech constantly stops in mid sentence on p9p and I have to restart it to try and finish a simple sentence 2 or 3 times  on p8  it was almost flawless yeah sometimes got words wrong but rarely this is probably not p9p specific  but using an external secretsvault service 1password is significantly more difficult than it was on my p8  Chrome and Firefox both try and take over secrets and auto complete  even though I have 1password set  Im stuck 75 of the time going to 1pw and manually copypasting info  which Im certain the copy buffers are being recorded by Google  tin hat mode invoked It runs VERY hot while charging I understand thermodynamics to a degree  but this is off the charts from any phone Ive had in 30 years  using nonGoogle supplied 45w charger it charges insanely slowly  like 8 hours to go from 10 from overnight to 100 using the google supplied p8 charger block which I think is 25w facial recognition is a LOT worse in lower light conditions than it was on the p8","763":"Hi all lifelong Android  then Pixel user since 2018 checking in with some questionsI currently use a Pixel 7 but Android Auto and Bluetooth calls is unusable on my new car I tried my friends Galaxy  Apple devices and it works without issue So I know it is a device issue and not car issueAs it is easier to switch a phone then a car and the Pixel 9 still has ongoing modem issue I am considering switching to a Galaxy S25I saw reviews of the S25 but have some niche questions that were left unanswered in the reviews listed belowBloatware I used a Galaxy S5 back in the day and was not happy with the amount of preinstalled unremovable bloatware that came with the device Is this still the caseForced Apps Going along with the bloatware question are there any apps Samsung forces you to use I havent used a Galaxy since the S5 but there were so many random Galaxy apps like Sfit and Snotes if I remember correctly that you couldnt remove is that still the caseDeveloper Settings I turn off all UI animations on my Pixel using developer settings does turning on developer settings break any core features on the phone Ie Google wallet or banking appsThats all the questions I have for now I am not too picky with my phone and honestly love the Pixel but Android Auto and handsfree calls being unusable is a deal breaker for meThank you","764":"A little bit of background My wife has a windows surface pro laptop refuses to use a mac but loves her iphone and refuses to use android again after the Samsung S22 and pixel 4 years We got two little children baby and one 5 year oldI heavily used iphones still have an iphone 15 pro max 512gb but recently got a pixel and LOVE IT More than the iphone Ive used pixel 3 4 6 7s in the past and didnt like it for various reasons My apple ecosystem apple tv fitness plus arcade disney macbook pro 16 late 2024 model mac studio with studio display and apple keyboard largest ipad pro from 2021 with the magic keyboard thing 2TB icloud drive Still have my old mecomhttpmecom email Airpod 4 and airpod pro Apple watch ultra I still use all of these from time to time My apple watch is super useful for workouts I buy movies on apple since we have ipads for travelingWork ecosystem No apple products in USA government job Only use windows related hardware and software Google ecosystem 2TB cloud drive and gemini advanced pro that came with the pixel Youtube premium that comes with youtube music Pixel 9 pro XL Rolex Batman mechanical watch Google Fi cell service Chrome browser as its more compatible with many features on websites and the auto translate is awesome So why did I switch The pixel seems to be more advanced and do more things than the iphone even in prior pixel years The hardware SUCKED compared to iphones in the past Now the pixel hardware is superb and the softwareAI features are an awesome start for our world into AI In other words I got bored of the iphone and switched to pixel which makes me more excited to use daily Would I switch back to iphone full time use one day Sure maybe But for now I got the best of both worlds as my iphone as my secondary phone and my pixel as my main phone I cant connect my phones to work stuff because of work policies but its ok iMessage I mainly use whatsapp RCS helps but whatsapp is my main messaging service My whole family i mean ENTIRE family has iphones I am the only one that now uses android mainly I get asked did you get my imessage I smile and tell them nope I use whatsapp now on my pixel Especially while in Europe whatsapp is heavily used I use to care about the blue bubble and being included in family chats but not anymore Plus imessage only allows 10 people in a group whereas whatsapp allows over 1k in a single group chat not like ill have that many family members in a group chatIf pixel had some sort of premium workout program like the apple fitness stuff then id be all in probably with pixel watch and buds  Now if i posted this in the ios or iphone subreddit Ill surely get hateful responses ","765":"First I wanna say thanks to everyone here  so glad to have found this sub I am completely nontech so am trying to degoogle blind folded not really knowing what Im doingI started degoogling bc I freaked out when my Xmas present was a Pixel But now Ive started seeing on threads that its the best phone to degoogle on very confusing to me Something to do with ROM if someone could explain that to me if its important to know please So Im in the process of taking things down I started with the launcher browser photos and messenger I still need to do app store etcI had a few issues with this sub not loading on my phone and became completely paranoid So now not using the Reddit app and going through Brave instead as one Redditor suggested except I dont understand why this is betterIs there anything I need to do in particular for my Pixel phone Is it possible to do it in one hit I dont think Im techy enough to forego Android and it seems like its still ok to useThanks everyoneEdit will my approach thus far work well enough to degoogle or do I really have to change the OS just because its a Pixel phone","766":"Hello everyone Ive been using a P9 for about a month Im coming from a 4 years old Oneplus 8 Overall the phone is ok it takes great photos but other than that and the great build qualitydesign it didnt feel like much of an upgrade I just needed a new phone because the Oneplus battery got quite friedMy issues with the phone1 Android auto calls have no sound  microphone doesnt work Known issue for the P9 on AA support forum2 Apps are always killed in the background any app Cant keep anything running in the background very annoying while gaming  Im playing PUBG I tried enabling background usage for specific apps it didnt make a difference This wasnt an issue on the OP83 Buttons placement4 Bottom speaker placement  it should have been on the other side of the charging port in my opinion in order to not get muffled while watching content in landscape mode5 Charging speed is slow even compared to my 2020 Oneplus 86 It gets hot quite easily7 Battery life is not consistent varies from one day to another8 No way to turn off the screen other than the power button double tap on home screen for example9 Homescreen searchbar and at a glance widget not removable10 Google photos is annoying and bad  its sole purpose is to make you purchase google drive storage11 Screen borders bezel too thick  compared to my 2020 OP812 Call sounds routing to headphonesWhen the call is ended the sound is routed to phone speakers for 2 seconds you only hear the call ending tone in the phone speakers not in the headphones This is not such a big deal but it just shows how much attention Google put into the basics of this phone  not too muchConsidering all of these Im thinking about returning the phone I have 60 day return policy My question here is how many of these issues mainly the software related ones 1 2 12 are also present on the P9 Pro I like the phone overall and I would be willing to make a compromise and get the 9 Pro for the great camera and the long term support if some of these issues are not present Otherwise I will just wait for the Oneplus 13 to be available in Europe Thanks","767":"Doesnt existMy Pixel 8 would overheat in about 20 minutes on my wireless car charger popping up a warning to remove phone from charger 100 of the timePixel 9 stays charging while connected to   Android Auto while streaming music in direct sunlightVery impressed","768":"Title sums it up I got an E7 and Pixel 9 Pro fold but even when I stick my phone directly to the AP I never go above 2882Mbps PHY as seen in the screenshots What can be the limiting factor here1 The AP is properly powered2 Im the only one broadcasting on the 6ghz spectrum so no interference3 Unifi network settings set to AUTO4 Latest Android firmware and latest AP firmware5 5Gbps500Mbps ISP planThe weird thing I see is that Im always maxing out the PHY at 2882 so it makes me wonder if its a software limit","769":"I owned a Pixel 2 and loved it Compact and light Always on display now playing photo sphereit was incredible for its time However it eventually wore out and I was left with a choice between the Pixel 6 or a Samsung S22 I dont like phones the size of dinner plates so I went with the Samsung It was a great phone Fast forward to this year and TMobile had a great tradein offer for a Pixel 9 Pro so I figured I would cash in my S22 while I could still get a lot for it I wish I didnt and this is why1 The P9P is heavy The S22 was super light but now I feel like Im lifting a brick by comparison Perhaps thats the price to pay for a better battery which is admittedly quite good on the Pixel2  The Bluetooth is awful I have an older car 2007 with builtin Bluetooth for calls only This was before Android Auto Ive never had a problem with any device on it but the Bluetooth connection with the P9P on my car is very unstable It will cut off after about 30 seconds on a call Ive pairedunpaired reset BT cleared cache etc etc Nothing works and both the car and phone work perfectly with any other BT device3 The camera just isnt that special anymore I loved Photo Sphere but its gone Theres really nothing about the Pixel camera thats any better than the Samsung 4 The pure Android experience is a buggy disaster The Samsung UI was much easier to navigate Moreover Android will randomly change my phones language without me asking it to Ive seen this complaint from others on this forum as well5 Pixel support is a nightmare I can barely understand their thick accent and they just walk through the standard stuff and are generally unhelpful They wanted me to do a factory reset or take it to a repair center I dont think there is anything about this phone that is defective There just needs to be some kind of software fix   Sorry for the rant If anyone has any suggestions Id be grateful I really want to like this device but Im finding it difficult  ","770":"I had held off on Lineage as my 4a was fine I was ignoring the reboot to update popup and had auto update on reboot disabled so thought I had bested googles sinister plot to destroy my phone I couldnt really afford to update since I had to have certain apps working and couldnt be certain they would on Lineage also really not wanting to buy a new phone if they didnt since this one was otherwise 100 functional I accidentally hit update when the popup came out of nowhere while texting which I suspect was googles scheme all along So I installed Lineage with nothing to loseAwesome experience I loved how concise the instructions were with multiple extremely clear warnings Appropriate since theres a fairly significant chance youll brick your phone if you do the wrong thing No fault of Lineage and again I suspect google does this is some small part on purpose I think in a few places the instructions may have been a little TOO concise if I hadnt already known what a step meant from experience it wouldve had me on forums before going to the next step but overall very good A couple of takeaways Ive had from this All my core security apps worked as before to my surprise Banking flights government apps etc No root I wouldnt unless I had to This echoes a lot of other peoples experiences Ive read about A side effect of avoiding google where possible is the backup process was manual and tedious Very annoying trying to restore all my apps and configs I had a second android phone with a wrecked glass screen galaxy a11 that I duplicated everything to It was a good way to dry run my backups as well Probably wouldve been a breeze with root I imagine I had forgotten I had spacedesk installed on my computer this lets you use your phone as an external monitor including sound and touch Incredible app for lack of a better term it hijacks the driver in some way Confused the hell out of me for a good 20 minutes as it was deleted from my phone and the phone was still talking about spacedesk I thought it was malware I didnt want to progress without knowing the driver was acting like the install guide said it should I took screenshots of my installed apps as a backup Not realising you can use the play store  manage apps not installed to see everything youve ever installed and also batch install them I also didnt realise that installed apps often have different names to the official name on the app store which makes them hard to find again Worst of all I didnt realise some apps I use are no longer on the app store at all such as the great lithium epub reader I shouldve confirmed this beforehand and extracted the apks I dont really want to install from shady apk mirrorsedit  having separate wifimobile data button back is an incredible blessing as well as having the power button not held hostage to the google cameraOverall awesome though Ill be ordering a new battery once they come back in stock and will 100 be using this phone until either the Lineage team stop supporting it or I destroy it by accident There is no reason for phones to have the lifespans they are given by vendors if you dont play videogames or similar high intensity activity theres no reason a mid range shouldnt be able to last 10 years Playing media and using the internet thats it","771":"Fellow brethren This is something that I did for eeking out the maximum battery on the Pixel without sacrificing any features in the previous guides Ive seen hereSwitching back to 60hz uninstalling social media apps etcSo Ive had the Pixel 8 for almost 2 months now The battery life when I received the phone was around 5hr SOT which got better after the adaptive battery kicked in 6hrs Now as the days passed I felt this itch to squeeze more out of the phone battery I got good reports of battery usage on the Android 15 beta so I switched over Now the SOT became 65hrs Not good enough Then I took the steps below and the phone gets around 8hrs SOT regularly Its also important to note that I never had any issues with my phone like call drops or shitty signal or random reboots etc I use internet and WiFi sparingly and the battery stats here are not just on WiFi Also bear in mind that Im on A15 beta The phone is flawless for me1 Use a really good battery monitor Pixel inline battery monitor is okay but its not great BetterBatteryStats is the king of all monitors But sadly it doesnt work on android 15   So I used two Accubattery and Gsam battery monitor Both are really good But Gsam has more data recording and visualization graphs for heat battery CPU usage and a lot more Also accubattery doesnt record how much battery the phone signal WiFi CPU android system Kernel etc use While Gsam records all those and wakelocks of your phone You can get the premium versions from Mobilism listed in the wiki of rpiracy which I think gives you some extra features You will need to grant Gsam some extra permissions with adb2 Install macrodroid and get the Enhance battery life V2 macro from the macro repository inside the app If you understand feel free to move on to the next one but  If you find the above sentence dense heres a breakdownMacrodroid is an app which executes macrosscripts that you install on the phone For example you can install a macro to turn on flashlight when you shake the phone or turn off WiFi if no networks are detected within 20 seconds etcNow there is a huge repository for macros inside the app itselfin the bottom panel and then search for it and the one that you want to install is called Enhance battery life V2 macro This enables battery saver when the phone is locked Locking it to 60hz and putting tasks into idle quicker Hence you get very low standby drain on the phone You might need to give macrodroid admin rights on the phone and enable androidpermissionsWRITESECURESETTINGS via adb Dont worry itll be given in the macro instructions what to do or a quick Google search will help you out Screenshot attached of how the macro should look like finally3 Using savetuner This is a FOSS app which changes how your batterysaver mode deals with applications You can set extreme savings to default settings in the app I set it to extreme and tweaked the settings a bit screenshot attached to get real time updates from apps but also put them into deep sleep otherwise Now this pairs very well with the macro above as your phone does the extreme saving when its locked The phone also doesnt kill apps in memory and I have retrieved an open YT video hours later at the same point from the recents menu 4 Use 4G I know this might be a deal breaker for some people but for me it works great I get the speeds I want from it the phone doesnt heat up and stays cool I also havent had any drops in signal or inability to receive calls etc Also my location is off mostly and Bluetooth is on most times connected with my watch5 Optional Using A15 beta Things are much much smoother The animations the performance of the phone etc If you do update clear the storage of Device health services app everytime you do it This will reset the adaptive battery and brightness stats For some reason this helps the battery life I also have now playing Ok Google and all the bells and whistles of the Pixel device on6 Debloat your Pixel phone Yes you heard me right Pixel OS is supposed to come with no bloat but it isnt There are codes and processes which are useless running all the time in the backgroundThere is an amazing FOSS app called Canta which helps your debloat your phone It has a tag called recommended which recommends the apps you can debloat They have been tested such that if you remove it nothing breaks It has a description of what the app does if you click on it so you can decide if you want to remove it Ive attached screenshots of the apps I kept on the phone out of the recommended bloat such that you dont lose any features If you accidentally uninstall any app that you want dont worry You can easily reinstall it anytime using the same app I dont use android auto or safety or pixel tips etc so you dont find them in the save list You can decide for yourself with the descriptions7 Use the 20  80 rule I charge my phone almost always in the range for maximum battery life I use battery to check the current battery health even though I doubt the accuracy My last phone Realme I ran it for 6 years with the same battery with this rule8 Using Icebox and disabling background usage Icebox is an app

Instagram and Snapchat to Icebox Now this will freeze the app like you disabled it so you wont be able to find in the app drawer when you unlock your phone No worries you can add a shortcut from icebox for any app you freeze so that you can open it after unlocking the screen Ive also disabled background usage for some apps like WhatsApp but this will result in you losing access to microphone

to its death bed The battery has lost so much health the charging port has become extremely loose it struggles connecting to wifi and is generally showing its ageI want to upgrade soon and really want to upgrade to a foldable but I cant decide on whether to get the OnePlus open when it goes on sale or wait until the pixel fold 2 comes outThe OnePlus Open looks like an incredible device It has a great aspect ratio great battery great performance and its cheaper compared to the other devices especially considering its 512gbs but customer support and potentially buggy software give me pauseThe pixel fold 2 also looks really appealing It has the same great aspect ratio actually a little better since the inside screen is bigger Ill be familiar with the software since I currently use a pixel and as someone who likes to use phones until they die the 8 years of software updates Google has been pushing looks really nice Itll also be a newer gen device than the OPOBut we dont know anything about the price battery capacity and as someone who wants to start gaming on their phone with the big screen the tensor chips havent been giving me a lot of hope I also wasnt impressed by the first pixel fold It has weak performance battery life a bad hinge and a middling crease We dont know if the pixel fold 2 will fix thatNormally I would just wait until the pixel fold 2 comes out and pick but

switching back to Samsung or iPhone Cannot tolerate this in the carBut for this issue I would completely invest myself in the Google ecosystemIt is the first time that Google has the potential to destroy Apple but this issue may thwart this possibility ","778":"Ive been using this watch for a month now and as a tech and sports enthusiast I want to share my opinion on a product that seems to have the potential to bridge the gap between smartwatches and sportwatches I say seems because as Ill explain it has some significant limitations that are hard to overlook for anyone serious about sports Strangely these issues are often not highlighted in other reviewsFor context Ive been using the Pixel Watch 2 for daily activities and a Garmin Forerunner for sports tracking  Smartwatch FeaturesWhen it comes to smartwatch functionality theres not much to criticize Compared to the Pixel Watch 2 the new model offers a larger screen even in the 41mm version which is always easy to read and a muchimproved battery life lasting up to 2 days without issuesAll apps run smoothly allowing you to do practically anything respond to WhatsApp messages handle calls with acceptable volume check emails and monitor health metrics If you own a Pixel phone there are added perks such as synchronization of modes eg rest do not disturb alarms and the ability to control your phones camera with a live preview on the watchSports FeaturesHeres where the problems start Google has heavily promoted its new running and structured training features now natively integrated into the Fitbit app These are essential for those aiming beyond casual jogging However during actual running sessions the watch becomes nearly unusable Instant pace The pace calculation is wildly inaccurate with constant nonsensical fluctuations Alwayson display Not all data updates in realtime Some require manually activating the screen which is frustrating if youve disabled wristraise activation Pace alerts When using structured training the pace alerts often incorrect due to bad calculations can drive you insane Battery life After just 50 minutes of running with GPS tracking and music playback the battery dropped from 80 to 30 This is embarrassingly short for a device meant to support sports activitiesFor strength training the experience isnt much better If you want to follow a routine and track weights and reps youll need a thirdparty app as Fitbit only tracks time and cardio activityOne last note about the Fitbit app while its welldesigned and provides plenty of data its frustrating that sleep tracking only shows a summary unless you subscribe to Fitbit Premium This limitation feels unreasonable  ConclusionIf youre looking for a smartwatch and dont have high expectations for sports tracking the Pixel Watch 3 might currently be the best Android option available However if like me youre seeking a device that can replace a dedicated sportwatch like Garmin youll be disappointed and will likely need to continue using two separate devices","779":"I would like to share my experience and thoughts about the Pixel 9 including a comparison with the Galaxy S22I respect that its a good phone which might work great with others so the following are just my personal thoughts and why it didnt work out for me I wanted to replace my Galaxy S22 due to its quite poor battery life and after a lot of research I decided on the Pixel 9 due to its clean Android experience and for what was marketed as a compact AIdriven flagship After spending some time with it I decided to return it for several reasons 1 Camera The Pixel 9s camera can take decent photos but at this price point I expected more versatility I found myself missing the telephoto lens of the S22 which has been included in most flagship phones for years Another important omission is the lack of manual controls its an interesting choice to not allow adjustments for ISO or shutter speed Most phones include a manual mode so this was really disappointingOverall in auto mode I would say the Pixel 9 takes similar photos to the almost 3 generations back S22 about 90 of the time and better ones 10 of the time That would have been fine if it offered manual mode or a telephoto lens to complement its strengths2 Size weight and feel This was the dealbreaker for me Despite being marketed as a compact flagship this phone is anything but compact It feels like a brick in hand with flat thick sides that are made worse by the topheavy design caused by the massive camera bump This is far from a onehand device and coming from a genuinely compact phone in the S22 I couldnt ignore the size differenceWith a case on the phone becomes even more cumbersome On top of that the massive front camera hole is very distracting and I could never quite get used to it Its a shame because aside from these issues the phones design feels nice and premium3 AI The new Tensor chips AI capabilities were heavily promoted but they dont feel groundbreaking I was expecting on device AI with things like Gemini nano but as of now it only runs online Comparing the Pixel 9s AI capabilities to the S22 theres not much to gain For example the eraser tool to remove unwanted objects from photos which I use frequently works similarly on both phones That said I found the screenshots feature really helpful4 Inefficient CPU The efficiency of the Tensor chip was another disappointment Tests show that it consumes a lot more battery than the latest Snapdragon while performing the same tasks which is not good news for the longevity of the battery It feels like a larger battery had to be included to compensate for this inefficiency which contributes to the phones bulkiness However in terms of performance the phone runs smoothly and I didnt encounter any issues with the tasks I use it for5 Other things Even smaller features like the promoted weather app fell short The AI summary feature is a nice touch but the design feels uninspired and bland compared to others like the S22s weather app Overall considering the price of the Pixel 9 and the hardware it offers I dont think it justifies the premium costThe quest for a decent compact flagship continuesI hope the Pixel 10 gets things right with a compact release better hardware and a competitive price","780":"Hi everyone Hoping to get a little clarity regarding the pixel passthroughbypass charging feature introduced in the December update Ive read conflicting things and from my own experience with it Im left a little confused still so hoping this will help clear up some confusion on the new feature Couple questions I have1 The intention is for the battery to stop charging when it hits 80 and then it will be powered by USB or wall outlet power Does the battery dip below 80 and then constantly get recharged back to 80 This seems to be what Ive observed If this is the case does this do more harm to the battery2 I had my phone charged to above 80 this morning

phone not the best either I recently had some problems with the screen and I decided to get something new I didnt want anything extra large so I was positively surprised that Google was about to start selling Pixel 9 Pro in the size of regular 9I purchased it in the preorder and just got it yesterdaySo far  my old sim card did not work correctly I had serious internet connectivity issues I managed to swap it to esim and it works now The card was very old 10 years  I had to drive for a few hours and I connected the phone in the car with usba cable slow charging Having google maps on  internet radio vRadio app made the phone very warm Not hot but still My recent samsung was always cool in such situation Gemini doesnt work as Google Assistant and the Assistant in Android Auto is as shitty as always Not sure what was I expecting  I left the phone unplugged for the night with 50 battery and in the morning it had 10 left Yes it had always on display and I checked it was the Google app that ate the battery and I was able to forbid it to work in the background But stil it is suuuuuper disappointing Galaxy had poor battery but in such situation Id still had like 45 in the morning Im shocked at how bad the clean Android experience is with the apps folder Samsung does it waaay better If I wanted a phone where Im not able to find anything Id get an iphone I know I would get used to it I cannot turn off the phone by pressing the power button  apparently this is an android feature the screen is by default set to a lower resolution than native and when I tried to change it to the full res I got the warning that it will drain the battery faster  Why do they put a hiress screen into the phone and then recommend to not turn it onI will play with it today and tomorrow but for now I have a strong feeling about sending it back asking for the refund Even if it means problems with getting my regular sim card from the carrier S20FE doesnt support esim and the physical card was deactivatedWhat are the pross camera seems very decent I still need to test it in the night screen is nice and super smooth although not that big difference compared to the old Galaxy it had already 120hz awesome haptics iphone level stuff  For the money they wanted for it its a great disappointment so farIf I change my mind over the next 24 hours and decide to keep it I let you knowCheers

pocket to get the P9PF and didnt hesitate as I wanted to come back to the Pixel the 2 XL was my first and most favouriteIve been Googling my issues but I dont really see anyone else having the same

annoying that it doesnt work with Google WalletTheres a few things that Ive gotten used to on the Z Fold5 that the P9PF doesnt feature floating windows theatre mode in YouTube that allowed me to view

in 20 of the time Most of the time when I plug in my phone to my car and press the Android Auto icon on the screen of my car the phone shows the message Android Auto is connected but the screen of my

GrapheneOSA privacy focused Android OS that runs on Pixel devices Allows google produces google play services store ect to be installed on a sandboxed environment where app accessibility and permissions can be set05 installInstall was super easy and doesnt require root in fact they advocate against it Just follow the instructions and buttons on their website no command line required Referring my 7 pro to stock was also easy using Googles tool1 What doesnt workLets start off with what doesnt work Google wallet Tap to pay does not work due to some security checks by Google wallet that I dont understand This is a known issue that has to be resolved on googles end probably wont beThis is essentially the only thing that inherently Doesnt work2 What works that surprised meAll exclusive pixel apps are still available to me It looks like as far as google is concerned it is a Pixel still You can install them through the play store A notable exception right now appears to be Gemini which suddenly stopped working Google assistant works perfectlyAll banking apps I have work as like my as Exploit protection comparability mode is enabled for each of them Im unsure what this is exactly  aside from just extra protections but into GrapheneOS  but disabling them on a per app basis seems necessary for my banking appsGoogle services without network permissions GrapheneOS adds the ability to deny any network access to individual apps This was great for me because I love GBoard but didnt love the idea of every keystroke being sent to google The app works perfectly without Internet access as long as you download the voice model first for voice to text obviously gif search doesnt work without Internet though RCS Some people have reported issues with RCS but it seems to work fine for me I made sure google play services GS and Google messages had the appropriate permissions including SMS in GS and I installed carrier services It took 2 days to activate but has been working flawlessly since it worked on my 7 pro as wellAndroid auto can be installed through the GrapheneOS store and run in the sandboxed environment Wired and wireless work flawlessly3 What doesnt work that surprised meHighlighting words in the recentrunning apps screen I didnt realize this was a Pixel feature and not an Android one Honestly I used this all the time and it sucks not having itNight mode No dim the screen at night of disabling always on display just at night No adaptive charging during night time This actually does kinda suck although my work around has been a timer on an extra smart outlet I had to start charging at 6am Ive found that GrapheneOS beliefs this feature is unnecessary and is already dealt with by the hardware I dont know enough to weight in Feel free to ask questions Im not a contributor to the project and I know little about it but I love the idea of an Android phone with all of the best parts of AndroidPixel that doesnt just allow google to take

accordingly","791":"Apologies if this is too brutally honest for the sub I made a Reddit account just to share my frustrations Its been a few days with the Pixel 9 pro fold after using Galaxy folds since the Fold 2 Here are my thoughts Display colorFirst off the biggest issue is the display being so washed out and cold Many people have mentioned this as I show them my new phone in person Anything white I take a picture of comes out blue on screen Pictures make skin tones look like a ghost So I bumped up the saturation only to find out that it was the display What finally looked normal ended up looking completely oversaturated when shared to any other device To remedy this I installed a color filter app to help make everything warmer Its the only solution Ive found so far but unfortunately gives a hazzy overlay  Dual panel split viewAlso all apps use a splitview thing when opened making the info the same as if it were folded ie chat on one side convo on the other Just open Google maps and youll see a good example On my Galaxy fold all the apps were blown up to use the entire screen real estate Software quirksAlso a ton of weird software stuff like a globe icon where the back button used to be so Im constantly hitting it to hide the keyboard but another globe icon in the keyboard already Why are there two And the constant moving side scrolling of text for the names of the toggles in the notification panel Cant it just resize smaller Not to mention the build number is this not official software All icons are forced to this odd circular shape No options to adjust the haptic feedback of keyboard Neither is there ability to adjust the brightness of the flashlight torch Battery percentage is sometimes showing up but too often only showing an ambiguous until time No gestures for split screening Third party launchers having bizarre glitches Scrolling feels stuck takes much more effort to flick it And more Wifi auto on feature but no auto off Pros Screen ratio and Camera quality apart from the display making both look lifeless Battery life is absolutely phenomenal Reaching 67 sot every single day  Additional thoughtsI didnt realize how much functionality would be lost in Smartthings Im deep into that ecosystem with smart home appliances and accessories I cant fault the Pixel for that but its still a gripe What are your thoughts and is anyone else experiencing this Feel free to disagree and share some fixesUPDATE REPLY TO COMMENTS BELOW  You guys nailed it Yes ALL my issues absolutely could be changed through software updates But I highly highly highly doubt it will happen Stock android is way overdue for an overhaul I played with a Huawei fold yesterday and let me tell you they are decades ahead at the pace Google is moving at Youve

ROM YAAP that allowed me to use the optical fingerprint sensor when the screen was fully off This was really handy as I didnt want to use Always On Display to accomplish thisWhen I upgraded to Pixel 8 I lost that feature but was able to get it back using the Double Tap Screen Off Lock app formelry Pixel Toolbox which achieved it by using an overlay on top of the AODFrom the custom ROM on my 7T I was aware that Google had created a virtual sensor that sensed when the fingerprint sensor area on the screen was pressed and held briefly with the screen off Using Tasker I found this sensor on my Pixel 8 and tried a number of different things to simulate the screen off fingerprint unlock including sending a intent to the system to briefly show the Ambient Display but the fp sensor was never triggered as well as using AutoInput and the face unlock feature together But this didnt work well or at allI just upgraded to the Pixel 9 Pro and decided to give this a try again knowing that it has an ultrasonic sensor which doesnt need light to work and Google is planning to add this feature to Pixel 9 in Android 16httpswwwandroidauthoritycomandroid16screenofffingerprintunlock3510174 and was very pleasantly surprised to discover that it worked and was extremely easyProjectNo Always On Display or additional apps needed  Works on the Pixel 9 and 9 ProPro XL tested only on 9 Pro1 All you need is a profile that is triggered by the Any Sensor event and select the sensor called Proximity Gated Long Press Gesture wakeup and change interval to none2 Then use it to trigger an empty task Yes empty as in literally use any action and then disable it within the task And thats it Turn off your screen and try to unlock the phone by placing your registered thumbfinger on the correct spot and it should unlock the phoneEDIT Import project httpswwwredditcomrtaskersUoGgLw3W2PAs the sensors name suggests it uses the Proximity Sensor to determine if it should be triggered or not like in your

music was still playing  Im at a total loss here for whats going on  I cant imagine calling Google support on this at this time of the day so figured Id come here to see if its something others have experienced and figured out  Thanks","798":"As all things end I will start with a disclaimer The oneplus i13 is running color OS with China ROMNow I have had both of this devices for a week now By some cruel twist of fate I lost my s23Ultra and someone gifted me the P9 while I bought the OP13These two devices are such a big contrast in design language The pixel 9 feels better in hand like a warm blanket The oneplus is a cold device It ticks every mark Battery life is superb network connectivity is great display is stunning but I keep reaching for my P9The oneplus has its advantages 15day battery life is great Charging to 100 while am in the shower is amazing I have no battery anxiety with this phone P9 is a 18hr phone And it charges so slowly that I have to leave it plugged overnight lest I wake up  with a dying batteryThe display on the OP13 is really good The colors vivid the P9 has a very weird issue with screen brightness sometimes where it goes very dim in shaded areasThe cooling performance is worlds apart I have never felt the OP13 overheat The p9 starts overheating immediately I connect to Android Auto OP13 doesnt have android auto yetCameras the pixel 9 shines although I think the OP13 has also really good shots I am not a big camera afficianado so I would say they both have good photos compared side by side  In summary the OP13 has my cold logical mind The P9 has my heart","799":"Hey everyone  I recently got a used Mazda6 2009 from a friend and Im having trouble getting Bluetooth audio to work smoothly with my Pixel 8 The phone is already paired with the cars Bluetooth and when I start the car my phone shows as connected However when I try to play music on Spotify it plays through my phone speakers instead of the car speakers  Heres what Ive tried so far   Switching input sources using the Mode button  It cycles through FM AM and Sirius but Bluetooth BT never shows up as an option   Pressing the AUX button  Doesnt work unless I do something specific see below   Turning Bluetooth on and off on my phone  If I toggle BT a couple of times and then press AUX music will play through the car speakers But this isnt automatic and is super annoying to do every time  The weird thing is that my friends iPhone worked flawlessly with the car It connected automatically and she could just press play in Spotify and it would play through the car speakers  So am I missing something obvious here This is my first car so I dont have much experience with Bluetooth audio in cars Is there a setting I need to change or is this just a Pixel 8  Android quirk  Any help would be greatly appreciated","800":"Dont know if its just mine but I dont think so as theres too many threads here and on Google support forums about many of these behaviors  Ive been through almost every Pixel and while they all have quirks  this P9P is rough dealing with day to day  This is the first Pixel device that is borderline unusable as a daily swiss army knife   The P7Pro I traded last month had zero of these issuesGPS  It basically doesnt work most of the time  Its lost often hangs Maps and requires that I disable location stop Maps and flush cacheetc just to get it to work   Forget trying to use it walking or running its completely useless  In the car with Android Auto its often 24 minutes behind hangs or dead  It makes actually navigating with it nearly impossibleTouch Screen latency and control flakiness  I just came from a Pixel 7 Pro traded for the P9P and this was absolutely not an issue  Launch an app and try and select a function it takes a half a second or so to actually work and you end up selecting a function that you dont want  Ive been accidentally deleting emails sending messages to the wrong people etc  Its super frustratingThe Keyboard has a mind of its own  Similar to the screen latency the keyboard is fraught with errors  I cant remember the last time I had this many typos misspellings etc when using the on screen keyboard  Just trying to send a simply message I may have to retype 50 of the words several times to get the correct spelling  The keyboard just doesnt respond correctly  even swiping produces bizarre resultsNetwork connectivity  The phone cant remember either cellularSIM accounts andor cant arbitrate cellularwifi consistently  I have to reboot sometimes just to get it to connect and stay connectedOverall the phone doesnt respond correctly to most things  As I stated not sure if its just my particular unit or if the entire series has issues   Most of us are used to new Pixel releases having software problems that may eventually get ironed out  But this time it feels over the top to me at least","801":"Hi yall Im hoping some good samaritan here might have picked up a black Google

that were not options in my version of Android up to date After that they just blame Android developers saying they have done everything they can and say I should find someone else to help me Of course they never say what everything they can really is The app worked without issue for about 6 months until early May 2024 The app autoupdated and maybe Android updated while I was on a road trip

gaming on my phone and noticed the FF Pixel Remasters are available Purchased a few games to try the series and I already finished Final Fantasy Tactics The War of the Lions before starting Final Fantasy I and the proper mainline seriesNot much to really say about Final Fantasy I it has a basic story which I dont mind personally but theres not that much investment into the setting or characters because of it Gameplay is fine the Pixel Remaster comes with convenience of auto battling for trivial fights and helps cut down on time and save battery life I did like Final Fantasy Tactics more but thats a different gameplay style so I dont hold it against FFI that much the series did have to start somewhere More than half the spells seem useless because why bother casting status spells when you could attack or use offensive black magic and just kill the targets outright instead of opening yourself another turn to take damage Still I am glad I didnt skip this game it will be a frame of reference for the upcoming games and I do enjoy seeing how a series evolved with each entryIll be starting Final Fantasy II Pixel Remaster tomorrow or sometime next week My goal is to play every mainline Final Fantasy game eventually but I havent decided what Ill do about FFXI and FFXIV in the future when I can return to my PC","818":"So my main issue is simple my last phone was

bit outdated   Pixel 9  780 its a beautifull phone with nice camera but not sure if its worth its priceSo basically would love to have youre opinions on these devices at these prices or any other phones which could be a great match small note I dont want to go refurbished on this one","831":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here Thought Id share my experience after over 8 months of ownershipP8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release I use it with 5G on screen at full resolution dynamic smooth display refresh rate is on no bluetooth or tethering Brightness left on autoTLDR  Positives  camera quality great design OS with some caveats great screen some caveats too Negatives  everything elseCamera  beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line and this release is no exception Every shot has this mesmerizing Pixel touch and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit Videos are world class too not quite on the level of the iPhone but well get there eventuallyBeautiful and unique design  Its sitting in a clear case and in a sea of generic boring slabs it really stands out and doesnt go unnoticed People often ask me what kind of phone it is most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade nowVery long software support  Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene albeit with the following youll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years so its not really a positiveSleek OS  Android in its purest cleanest form Customization galore However as Ill mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly so I dont know if this count as a positive Gorgeous OLED panel  A truly beautiful display highresolution good brightnessunfortunately plagued by mutiple lags and frame drops in the UI Ill get back to that Now onto the negatives First off we must address the elephant in the room Battery life This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast The opposite of what you want right The 10 minutes top ups to 50 is a concept Google seemingly never heard of You want half a charge  Better sit  wait half an hour Full charge  Go watch a movie  Now the discharge and this is where the real drama clocks in This phone EATS battery ON IDLEOn your average 9 to 5 workday no camera no games just basic apps youll head home with 15 tops Phone dead by 7pm then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule better not be in a hurryNow try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone  A bit of pictures for work at 10am a short 4K video at 1pm a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm Youre now looking at a 4pm shutdownBut lets go real on the camera after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day Starting at 10 am  pictures videos a bit of editing about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each Shutdown at 1PMThe CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING Throw anything heavy at it and youll head home with a dead phone one that died long before your day was over Simple as thatKeep in mind that this is my experience with a 8monthsold device and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software supportNow we need to talk UI and animations because this isnt good either Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness but not here Actually some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz Switching apps isnt 120hz either nor is scrolling A TON of lags and various frame drops resulting in a framerate like 4090hz never stable with the occasional but very rare peak at 120 This isnt TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023 1159 flagship phone from GoogleThis phone FEELS slow and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so InfuriatingOne day I had to handle a coworkers A54 to tweak a few things I was SHOCKED by the smoothness this was indeed true 120hz which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos midranger I understand the need for a dynamic framerate not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasnt what I had in mindFinally the optical underdisplay fingerprint scanner This my friends is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018  One of the first phones with UDFS The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable still is most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device just in case Well this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro and no optical sensor backup in sightSometimes it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact tosuccessfully fail to unlock After it fails 3 times or so it will ask you to enter your password making onehand unlocks a luck job Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI As for faceunlock I know its there but I disabled it because it doesnt work in the dark no IR sensor and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height without having to raise it to my facePixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis And indeed it does look incredibly cool I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone but Id rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159TLDR  Positives

know your thoughts I just got a Flip 6 and with Google just announcing the Pixel 9 Pro I am very conflicted both phones have their unique and compelling selling points Hoping to get your own insights to help me with deciding if I should ditch my Flip and go for Pixel 9 Pro Im still in my return periodI know they are 2 very different phones and i know its down to my own use cases but im keen to know your own thoughts and reasons because Im stuck in an inbetween Sharing my personal thoughts below if it helpsForm factor Id go for Flip 6 because well it folds which I fancy Ive had a lifetime of nonfolding phones so this is an exciting change and Im liking it so farValue Flip is maybe ahead I got it 256GB for about 700 deals And it has 1 year accident insurance I will need to get Pixel 9 Pro at retail because they dont accept very old Androids in their trade in list and theres no insurance included Although Pixel 9 has free Google One AI Premium plan which gives me also 2TB free for a year which I currently pay 99 for So technically the net cost of Pixel 9 for me is 922AI Pixel probably has the best I think that Pixel has all AI features that Samsung has plus more eg Gemini Advanced Chat for a year I hate that I cant even use Google GeminiAssistant on Flip when its folded  I have to unfold it Dont know if Samsung would change that in the future Although I dont think I would actually use all AI features on Pixel eg I doubt I would be asking Google to check my availability for a concert because my calendar items are mostly on my Work profile which would be locked Or am I oversimplifying it Im not sureBattery Cant compare yet I find that by 8pm I need to recharge my Flip even though it says it should last a whole day Disappointing I would still use my phone a bit heavily doomscrolling haha until midnight and Id charge again at bedtime so its 100 when I wake up I think Pixel will have a better batteryCamera Pixel 9 Pro should win no question Very keen to get a powerful triple camera I come from Pixel 8 which has dual camera only But so far no major complaints with my Flip 6 I just know Pixel camera will be betterOther considerations I use Google Recorder and Ive even decided to move to Pixel phones from being a lifetime iphone user predominantly plus other reasons because of the Recorder app Flip 6 finally has a decent recorded that autotranscribes using AI so thats useful  but theyre not accessible on web in case I would change phones in the future and the transcription is not the best Though  I can make do with itAlso this is my first time

those who havent made a decision yetI used to have OnePlus in the past First 6 then 7 pro and I really liked both Then I moved to Pixel 6 Pro  Nothing Phone 2  Pixel 9 Pro XL So the stock very clean and minimalist Android aesthetics was my baseline before 13   Speed battery and overall feeling of the phone is great As in other reviews this is definitely a flagship which should last few years Unless you are gadgets freak as I am  All other good things you most likely already read so I wont repeat them   The things I wish I would knew before buying  When screen is on the lowest brightness level and dark mode is enabled there is blue tint visible while scrolling white text on dark background Super annoying if you are picky about such things Turning brightness up a notch helps  Android auto wired has a tendency to crash from time to time I wiped the cache and local memory for app and so far so good But initially it was rather common to happen  Quick setting tiles Every single time I turn on work mode it changes the order and selection of big quick setting tiles Instead of Bluetooth tile which I want to have in one particular place it puts wifi calling There is plenty of settings which is nice but somehow their naming is not self explanatory and I feel a bit overwhelmed while setting a phone I am tech savvy person so I like to play with features but here its no fun  Notification management Its detailed with plenty of options but as before  its difficult to get a proper feeling what is what and it requires time to set it up  Some notifications are not instant some of the apps are not working in the background by default All can be set up but again  manual and time consuming  On the standby screen app icons stays even though there is no new notification

menus from Pixel What I dont miss is average battery life OP 13 is amazing and the bulkiness  ","868":"Ive had the Pixel 6A for nearly 2 years It was the first Pixel I ever bought and I really enjoyed it for the most part despite the modem and mediocre battery But I paid about 280 bucks for it used so all in all it was a great value I have had the Pixel 9 Pro 256GB for about a week now and here are my thoughts Sorry if the format looks strange I cant adjust it for some reasonPositives The screen is probably the biggest upgrade for me The brightness is incredible I love that I can turn on the phone with my fingerprint scanner more quickly without the searing light when I wake up in the morning The high refresh rate and responsiveness are also noteworthy The design is definitely a step up from the 6A and other Pixels that I have held at Best buy I originally did not like the camera bump in the renders but the finished product is really cool I love the camera bump and how pronounced the large sensors are  Im definitely noticing more speed and less glitches with the apps  Ive definitely noticed more detail in my pictures and they are brighter as well I have now become the friend in the group where everyone wants to use my camera when they want to capture memories while were out  I know a lot of YouTubers have been criticizing the portrait mode but as a black man with short hair its been fantastic The cutouts are quite accurate I have shots of my sister and her niece that look like a DSLR camera  This selfie camera is incredible My friend shot a night selfie with his Galaxy s22 and when we compared them the difference was stark The phone is noticeably cooler than my 6A The modem is definitely better than the 6A but there are still some times where I want a stronger signal but it may just be where I am The battery is definitely better than my 6A but its not worlds better I know I should wait about a week for the adaptive battery to kick in so Ill revisit this later It does seem better than the initial few days thoughThe Bad The pictures are wonderful but at night the sky can have noticeable noise Im hoping that gets patched with an update I have been having some pretty inconsistent performance with Android Auto It typically connects quicker than my 6A but the audio drops out more consistently than my 6A Again I hope that is fixed with an update It also may be the aftermarket radio I will test it on my mothers newer Hyundai carAlso for those who have had Pixel flagships for a long time do you have any tips of what I should do to get more out of

to limit the number of devices for the first build to make things easier for us We like to test every single build before release and as you can imagine doing that for just 3 devices instead of 11 is a lot faster Every CalyxOS developer one of these devices Some have 2 That makes working much easier Not everyone has every other device We figured that itd be easier to start with a few devices fix some bugs and then release it for all Also because of the way things are anything that works on Pixel 6a should be fine for 6 and 6 Pro and so on for the others too We didnt want to release something too buggy  non functional At the same time no matter how much testing we do therell always be something we missed so its better to release it and get some feedback Pixel 6 6 Pro 7 7 Pro 8 8 Pro Fold Tablet Hoping to release test builds in the coming week unless something major comes up Pixel 9 Google released these devices with Android 14 but with an entirely different codebase compared to the rest of the pixels That wouldve entailed porting all of our changes to that codebase and keeping it up to date with the rest We decided to wait for Android 15 instead since we knew that Google would unify the codebases then they typically do that It was also apparent with the build IDs of the betas they released Were hoping to release the first test builds in the coming week unless something unexpected comes up FP5 FP4 Moto G32 G42 G52 Pixel 5 4a 5G 5a Were still evaluating Android 15 for all of these devices Each of them will need a lot of work to get things ported and running Well test all hardware functionality before deciding and post an update once we know more TimelineThe below gives an overview of how the CalyxOS team went about the Android 15 work August This was the initial earliest expected date based on past releases We were waiting for it and also used this opportunity to do some more preparation work A big part of that was going through every major change we made to Android 14 and reorganizing  cleaning them up for easier porting This was done at stagingandroid14rebasehttpsreviewcalyxosorgqbranchstagingandroid14rebase September 3 2024 Android 15 is released to

We began work integrating that right away The final release didnt differ too much from the beta we had based our work on for the Pixels which helped as we didnt have to do too much work to update it We also started work on the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro Fold since that didnt receive the beta release we were using for all other devices October 18 2024 CalyxOS 600 was being prepared for release when at the last moment we noticed an issue We wanted to be sure about it just in case so we decided to move the release by a day The issue was due to the changes Google has introduced for Factory Reset Protection Hardening in Android 15 This article Heres how Android 15 blocks thieves from bypassing factory reset protectionhttpswwwandroidauthoritycomandroid15factoryresetprotectionupgrades3479431 covers it well For CalyxOS since we dont have the proprietary Google code that handles this it meant we couldnt ask users to input their credentials to turn it off It is only an issue if your Pixel was already running Android 15 and you didnt Factory Reset from Settings before installing CalyxOS Regardless we wanted to err on the side of caution We have disabled this for now since its not useful for us right now Will revisit in the future October 19 2024 Noticed an issue with SMS sending due to AOSP not updating apps We found a patch on

which takes quite some time however that seems to break my call screening function on my phone I have to turn WiFi on for that to get set back up which then rebreaks the VVM requiring a storage clear to reconfigure I thought that WiFi Calling may have been an issue but that doesnt seem to have any effect I also have the developer option for mobile data is always active turned on already prior to

please dont say factory reset ","884":"I recently upgraded from an iPhone 12 Pro to a Google Pixel 9 I am liking it so far but I have several frustrations with it bearaly enough to almost break the camels back and go back to iPhone I was wondering if anyone can give me advice or thoughts 1 Battery is not as expected I was expecting to get about 13 hours on onscreen battery life but I am not getting close to that I am getting around 8 hours I recently found the issue or what I think the issue is at least After I use android auto it keeps running in the background all day and drains all of my battery2 When using Spotify to listen to podcasts every time a notification comes in it pauses the podcast plays the notification sound and 75 of the time it resumes the podcast The other 25 of the time it will remain paused for no reason 25 Sometimes the podcast will pause altogether on its own and then I have to press play to resume 3 When using Android Auto WhatsApp voice messages will not play The music volume will lower but the messages will not play 4 Whatsapp does not ring on Android Auto only on the phone so there is no Whatsapp interface on AA 5 On the contrary there is no phone call interface on the phone when youre talking through a regular phone call on Android Auto it only shows in your cars screen Which means that you cannot activate a feature like Call Notes while driving 6 Aggregation of health app data on iPhone all health app data would aggregate on Apple Health and every app would have every other apps data The equivalent on Android health connect is simply not good I use FitBod for strength training and MyNetDiary for calorie tracking On iPhone calories would automatically be aggregated through apple health and would automatically reflect on MyNetDiary but it is failing to do so using Health Connect It shows up as a workout on MyNetDiary but none of the important information like calories aggregates correctly so I must input it manually  Does anyone have any solution to these or can share their thoughts I really really want to stay on Pixel Android forever so I hope I can get at least some of these things fixed so that I dont have to go back ","885":"I was dead set on getting away from the Apple crowd I have been an Apple user for years and years I was done So 2 days ago I bought a google pixel 8 and was super excited store rep said people love these and I did my research I knew there were some bugs and minor issuesBut then I got home and started tinkering What a LAG FEST Scrolling in apps is awful it jitters non stop I actually remained at 92 battery yesterday because I hated using it so much I didnt pull it outAndroid auto kept freezing it was just a joke I paid 600 and thought this isnt worth 300 Calls dropped a few times and the phone overheated to the point I put it in the freezer for a few minutes to help I ended up returning it and going back to an iPhone I feel like 500 lbs is off my shoulders now from the stress of being stuck with this thing So to people like me who want to make the jump and are curious I seriously recommend you dont Broader options with android  isnt an excuse for such a lousy device Listen to the bad reviews they 80 right and not exaggerated Ill never buy one again ","886":"I have been using tmy pixel 7 for  2 months Bought new 5 hrs SOT  Android 15 100 to 21 with mobile data And not

phone to a WIFI access point or it wont update properly I dont generally set my phone up on WIFI since I have so much data it doesnt matter to me So I connected it it updated properly Afterwards I figured Id see if it had any impact on my Android Auto when I paired it it worked perfectly If anyone comes across this issue in the future try connecting to WIFI and running any updates Thanks everyone for the suggestions","889":"Hey all Just a short post here saying my last phone was a Pixel 5A and while I loved the actual Pixel software the 765g and limited RAM was really not great after a few years and often would overheat under moderate use in upstate NY lol Now having a Pixel 9 Pro I feel like Google nailed it This thing never gets beyond lukewarm with wireless Android Auto and light browsing like sitting in a parking lot and listening to some music while reading Battery has been solid reception and data speed has been solid software has been solid cameras better than ever I think the telephoto is a little bit overprocessed but that of course can be improved in time I know the tensor G4 isnt always loved by all due to it being a generation or two behind but as far as the way the efficiency and performance FEEL I think under most use its solid I believe now any improvements while welcome arent in dire need like they used to be Good job google I hope it only keeps getting better PS any advice for settings on pixel watch 3 I have a sneaking suspicion that my significant other got me one for Christmas Happy holidays all","890":"Ive been have major issues recently with the GPS on my P7P and to a lesser extent mobile connectivity but thats always been mediocre Its more or less unusable at the moment as it either lags behind by 3045s or just loses GPS connection altogether when Im driving Its not an app specific issue as two separate GPS satellite tracker apps show zero connections to satellites and resetting GPS data doesnt help when Im having problems All location services settingspermissions are enabled properlyIt works periodically but requires restarting the phone then 50 of time I get excellent satellite connectivity 17 fixed but it loses all GPS connectivity after driving for a few minutes Also strangely disabling location permissions on android auto which I never use also restores GPS connections but only temporarily This is independent of the mobile connection fwiw This issue only appeared recently for me in particular after the September update I was in Europe I live in Canada at the time and the phone autoupdated It was mostly fine in Europe but since I got back home the GPS has been quite bad Theres a ton of other reports for the pixel 6 and 7 from other users experiencing GPS issues though it seems to be driven by the June update for them Note that flashing an older firmwareupdate version seems to fix the issue for themFor the reasons above Im fairly sure its a software related issue however and hopefully not due to faulty hardware So has anyone with the Pixel 678 line phones with these issues managed to fix the problem by updating to Android 15 Im hesitant to test it myself bc theres also reports of A15 bricking some older models If this GPS issue isnt fixed in the next week or so I want to take advantage of BF sales and buy a new phone Hence why Im asking here I would trade in the P7P and cant do that if its bricked Thanks","891":"So i want to buy Pixel 8 and i really like the design of this phone and it seems like a perfect phone for me but The heating issue ive heard about makes me rethink my choice

experience they offered I eventually switched to a Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 after the charging ring on my Gen 6 watch broke and Fossil later announced they were pulling out of the smartwatch game I thought going for the first Wear OS 3 watch would give me a similar experience but forgot how much Samsung loves to change for the sake of change and how insistent they are on forcing their own apps onto you including Samsung Pay which isnt compatible with some of the banks I use Ive also briefly used TicWatch Pro 3 and TicWatch Pro 5 over these last few years but have returned them after a while because of problems with the strapsI was excited for the release of the Google Pixel Watch 3 but Im surprised that its been a far from perfect experience I thought other people who are considering a purchase might want to read some of the design decisions taken by Google that have detracted from my enjoyment of the device The demo Pixel watches in stores are all dumbed down watches with a very restricted OS Many of the apps are just preprogrammed videolike sequences that you cant interact with and so the watches dont let you explore any of the menu options in any meaningful way so you cant really explore the watch and see what its going to be like before you spend the money on it Google Fit is now entirely replaced by default by the Fitbit app which in itself isnt a bad thing but the Fitbit app is lacking some configurability options that really would improve quality of life The most glaring of these is the Fitbit app on the watch that when opened greets you with a list of information cards that cannot be changed in any way The fixed order of these is Cardio load Readiness Steps Floors Distance Calories burned Active zone minutes Exercise days Hourly activity Heart rate Resting heart rate Sleep Blood oxygen during sleep Skin temp variation Body responses and Mindfulness There is a settings option in the Fitbit app on the watch  the only option here is to sign out The cards on the Fitbit app for phone can be reordered but only in batches by category Individual cards can be turned on and off in the phone app only The Pixel Watch app for my phone that was used to set up the watch is in perpetual dark mode but the Fitbit app that you will switch to during this setup process still hasnt gained a dark mode and will blind you if you were enjoying the dark mode of the Watch app There are no options to configure heart rate tracking oxygen saturation or any aspect of sleep tracking  these are all on by default and at the level of tracking that Google has deemed These options cannot be turned off at all Im very glad to see some very dataheavy watch faces that can accommodate eight complications much like on the Apple Watch However they are all very monochromatic affairs Colours can be changed but it changes the colour for everything and so even though the quality of the screen is top notch its wasted on these watch faces which end up being a series of hued text on an OLED black background I would like the option here to see some additional colours on the included watch faces  the Apple Watch has a bit of colour in the icons and dials for some of the complications as do several in the Google Play Store Live heart rate data can only be seen from the watch face from a tile or from the card on the home screen of the Fitbit app on the watch after scrolling down most of the way Opening the heart rate info in the Fitbit app  on watch or phone  does not provide any live heart rate information There is still no option to check your oxygen saturation levels ad hoc this only happens during sleep And it happens during sleep whether you want it to or not since there is no option for configuring this The auto display brightness feature is good but in dark environments is too dark even on the highest setting The watch can automatically enter DNDbedtime mode when it detects that youve fallen asleep but again there is no option to configure what this mode actually does so its all or nothing including screen off The option to sync this with your phone existed with previous Pixel watches but is noticeably absent this time round The watchs automatic exercise tracking is a bit of a con It asks you after a minimum period of time has passed if you want to track the activity and no GPS information will be saved prior to this question being asked The time period cant be shortened to less than 10 minutes in the Fitbit app on the phoneIm annoyed by some of the items in this list because they are features that are present on Samsung and TicWatch watches and Im surprised that Google hasnt included them in their flagship device when other manufacturers are able to","894":"I must admit in the beginning I was quite satisfied

surprised how good Android has become after many many years of being an iPhone user since iPhone 4Anyways as I was browsing Reddit at night I pulled down the quick settings menu to dim the screen further then I noticed a couple of bold lines across the screen horizontally One static starting from the power button area One moving with the movement of the pull down of the menuAnd in general grainyness of this area and only noticable when the color gradient is greyI tried changed many settings resisting etc nothing worked So I requested RMA from Google and they are sending me a new phone as it seems to be a defective screen I hope the new one will be okay lets seeIf you guys can try and see if you have the same issue or not I would be grateful If it is like that then I will keep my pixel anyways as I like it But wanted to ask and see others experience as wellps The first day I got the phone when I push the power button to turn off the screen a white disappearing line like old tv

6 and now a Pixel 9 and this new phone performs terribly in comparison to the 2 older ones despite being horribly overpricedFor example typing experience is the worst on the phone lile the touches arent registered quickly enough and also the accuracy is quite low as well there are a lot of typos Word prediction is also useless does not even try to guess the next word based on the rest of the sentence iphones can do it and it worksI am typing on a bare screen without protective film or glassUsing the phone screen at 60Hz makes everything even worse as the entire GUI will register touches noticeably sluggishlyAlso the memory management is outrageous as the phone reloads apps constantly despite having 12 Gb RAM I am not closing apps but I only shuffle through only like 6 apps yet it still reloads apps most of the timeAndroid Auto is also defective with this phone as simply there is no sound during calls until both the phone and the car head unit is restarted I wont expect them to address the issue with future updatesThis phone pales in comparison even against pixel 2 which was truly legendaryBut still even the huge pixel 6 had better ergonomics ans general quality","913":"I

on the car screen so I did and it continued on with the music that was playing before I thought it too good to be true but I stopped for petrol on the way home and when I got back in the car it took a

about this Pixel 9 Pro Fold  HOWEVER  Software wise everyday I stumble on some dumb decisions Google made that makes me wonder whos piloting the ship over there and appreciate what Samsung has going onTodays annoyance  Android AutoSpecifically how the Pixel handles phone calls when interacting with Android Auto  Some genius decided that while using AA you wouldnt have access to your diamer screen at all including Bluetooth controlThis prohibits the ability to transfer the call out of the speakers into a BT headset if privacy is necessary if the background noise is loud or when you leave the car and the phone doesnt realize itA Google search confirmed this has been a Pixel issue for years with people requesting almost begging on Googles help forums to fix thisCalling tech support resulted in one scripted solution End the call disconnect from Android Auto connect a headset and re initiate the call And use the phone for GPSI advised him that that solution actually causes more distraction than just allowing me to access to the connection screen to switch connection types Hes going to let his supervisor know Anyway  Ill get off my soapbox  RANT","919":"Posted to rgooglepixel too Heres a very light review after 3 days Changed as was bored with IPhones and iOS Been using them constantly since IPhone 3GS Been a good ride Now change has come Havent changed phones since 10 XS Max as Ive been waiting for that damn island to disappear 16 was the straw Also not a fan of apple rebranding everything to their liking apple intelligence and their hypocritical sales policy Youre not a force for good youre just like most companies in it for the money stop pretending Always been in the garden but never ever a fan boy Being a fan boygirl for technology is ridiculous Be a fan of peace politeness and respect and good things like good food good weather good times and  good tech regardless of the brand  Love the box Minimal and eminently recyclable I know it costs them peanuts but still its a gorgeous minimalist eco design Better than the shoeboxes from before All you need I look at and use my phone not the boxcasing If a lack of wall charger or earbuds surprises you nowadays youre in for a hard lifeLighter than my 10 XS Max Most phones probably are nowadays Form reminds me of a cross between iPhone 6 S Plus Max cant remember and iPhone 5 for some reason but they were my personal fave iPhones Definitely a beauty Rocking the silicone google case Simplicity Plus have insurance so not worried about crippling drops Set upmoving across was a breeze Used a cable Took about an hourDont mind redoing all my passwords like keychain or 1 Password Gotta delete a lot So an excuse to spring clean Disappointed with subscription 1Password bought a premium account twice a while ago Bitwarden seems to be working fine Also no heating issues at all Phone temperature stayed ambient like the room Even everyday usage doesnt heat it at all But then I dont game or watch filmsseries on it thats what the Sony UHD and PS5 is for I do watch a few Premier League matches a day though on the weekends Bonus Sony uses Android TV so I can control and talk to my TV What a world we live in Scary And good Keyboard is noiiiice Love the haptic feedback without clicks As I have stubby thumbsfingers like pigs tits typing seems to be pleasurable again Had to retype everything on iPhone although my fault shouldve used swipe to type But the predictive text and auto correct seem supremely better I was getting some crazy nonsensical bullshit recently on the iphone Love the numbers at the top of the keyboard permanently And the very quick acces to multiple punctuation marks The one thing missing from ios is the spacebar to move the cursor anywhere not just one line at a time Still not a massive deal Or even a small one Im sure an app may solve it Like jailbreaking Ill live and learn Usage is easy to get used to Swipe gestures are like ios The universal back is a god send Love the simplicity and logic behind usage Although such in depth settings too And deep search within settings Gobsmacked Battery life has been stellar All day 0700  midnight use with 30 left at night 9 hours screen time And Im constantly playing with it and editing photos Which brings me to the camera One of the main reasons for getting this phone Its amazing Does all I want and the quality is crazy good  The built in ai is mind boggling and fun So easy to use especially with the pixel tips app Macro and astrophotography in one bundle count me in The zoom is excellent especially for a phone Add Me is surprisingly useful and a blast especially when adding 2 of the same person Magic Eraser is also useful bettermore convenient than using another app Also changing backgrounds is astoundingly good Portait is also not too bad when you adjust the blur manually The pan and long exposure is fantastic especially on a phone Havent tried much else such as video No bluetooth problems No connection issues at all One of the best things The monochromenight mode Absolutely love it Like I get a new phone each night And the always on lock screen What have I been doing in life to miss out on these thingsGemini is fun too Better than I thought and it does all my tasks easily includung Hue lights TV disappointing but true prognosis for my teams prospects and even opening and playing a song from Apple Music for the lossless still use wired speakers earbuds Plus quickfire questions to prove my kids wrong and that dad knows all Only things missing the spacebar see above the bottom address bar in Chrome and the tap to scroll up know I can get it with Touch the Notch Really not much at all considering the enjoyment and upgrades it brings Absolutely no regrets at all Love it Managed to get Pixel Screenshots and Pixel Studio working even though I live in France Well done APK mirror and side loading not achievable on iphone unless jail broken which I used to do a bit of to get Android features Maybe because my account was originally set up in the UK and I use US English on the phone Who knows They just work Overall a highly recommend phone coming from a 5 year old iphone But highly

Been trying to sort this out for months","922":"Hi allSome folks had wanted me to post on my thoughts and final decision comparing my S24 Ultra and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold  Heres that post httpswwwredditcomrpixelphonescomments1eyplqmboughtmyparentspixel9sthewifea9proandhttpswwwredditcomrpixelphonescomments1eyplqmboughtmyparentspixel9sthewifea9proandMy decision after a little less than a day of use Im keeping the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and will be selling my S24 UltraHere are the main points and reasons why Im going 9 Pro Fold Cameras This is the biggest category to me and I thoroughly enjoy having flagship cameras and never really thinking about whether or not Im getting the best in photography from a mobile device in auto mode  I dont shoot in RAW or Pro modes 99 of the time so thats not a huge consideration for me though both have those options if you need it Googles camera app is simply superior in showing the information you need has less lag and I like their post processing color science compared to Samsungs  I was shocked that standard shooting wide angle and tele photos up to about 10x were very comparable and like I said I like Googles post processing better  I think this is going to be a contentious take but the 9 Pro Folds Cameras met and sometimes what I was hoping to get I dont shoot a lot of video but it shoots 1080p and 4K footage pretty well to boot Feel I cannot stand the sharp corners of the S24 Ultra and really miss my S21 Ultra for its in hand feel  I have a case for the S24 Ultra that makes it more bearable but I prefer to be happy with the feel  The 9 Pro Fold has rounded corners on the right side while closed  hold it there mostly and rounded on all corners when unfolded  Ive been using the phone opened around 80 of the time so this is a major win in my opinion THE INNER SCREEN Yall have used foldables seen countless videos and know what a bigger screen means It has been an absolute delight using a massive screen to browse the web reddit use chat apps and keep a floating YouTube window  without feeling like Im losing out in much in those apps  Split screening apps work very well generally too  Its got vivid colors quick to respond and the S24 Ultra doesnt have one of these Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 vs Tensor G4 I dont do heavy gaming and generally do low key gaming when I do check out httpswwwkingdomrushcomhttpswwwkingdomrushcom best tower defense games ever IMO so thats not a big consideration for me  Day to day use is showing that the G4 performs just fine and seems to be as smooth as my S24 Ultra in everything I do  Its honestly slightly less buggy feeling since there arent duplicate servicesapps needed for every dang thing many of which I opted out of and used Googles versions anyway on the S24 Ultra so another thing for the 9 Pro Fold If you game on mobile heavily you may want to try one out or watch reviews that do proper gaming testing seems to be alright though Flavor of Android building on what I said in the last bullet point I prefer Googles twists on its own OS vs what Samsung does almost all of the time No app redundancies significantly less overhead on the system in apps that run in the background INSANELY fast shut downboot up times on the 9 Pro Fold etc  Many of you have been in both ecosystems and you may prefer one over the other but I think most want the Samsung hardware with Googles flavor of Android Screens in the sun Im going to have to test this but I dont think the 9 Pro Fold not having the anti reflective coating that the S24 Ultra has will be the end of the world  Ive enjoyed being able to see my phone without issue in the sun on the S24 Ultra but I also dont use my phone for more than a moment or two in the bright sun  I dont think I can personally let this be the reason why I dont keep the 9 Pro Fold The 9 Pro Folds screens get wicked bright so Im guessing thatll be enough to quell this loss Charging and battery I charge my phone throughout the day due to working in IT and having some desk time here and there  I also place it on a slow wireless charger at night  I dont get people that can 1 run a modern phone empty and 2 arent aware of small portable battery chargers or 3 able to carry a charger if theyre really beating their phones down to single digit percentages I think most scenarios I see are just irresponsible people so IMO figure that out Wired charging worked very well and was at 20w basically until 80 then went to around 1015w then out every battery does this The phone seems to last and last though and I have been doing a mix of video watching web browsing using apps like Reddit and other chat apps It seems to have really great battery life generally As long as you sleep and can plug it in I dont foresee this being a problem for a majority of people Weight It weighs something like 25g more than the S24 ultra aka peanuts  I barely notice it and the only reason I do is that with a case its slightly thicker than my S24 Ultra with a case  This doesnt at all matter to me and Im impressed with the 9 Pro Folds packaging overallIm droning on now but feel free to ask questions and Ill be glad to try and answer them  If youre just ordering a 9 Pro Fold good luck waiting the 150 months since it seems to be quite a wait for some now ","923":"I see a lot of posts here asking about going from iPhone to pixel so i write this post to hopefully help someone out About three weeks ago i felt bored of iOS and wanted to try something new First i picked up a used Samsung S20 FE but felt that was too big for me A few days later i then found the Pixel 7A on sale for an acceptable price This was the same day i went for easter holiday which meant i had a whole week with little distractions to get to know pixel and android Turns out i liked it very much My plan was always to use the pixel as a second personal phone with a data sim in addition to my iPhone that work pays for But i decided to try to use it as my daily driver with my main sim for a while The phone is fast with no lag anywhere i could find all apps i use daily was present and looked mostly the same i was also impressed with the camera it took great pictures in every situation except a sunset over the city here it struggled to choose what to prioritize and the result wasnt very good I also like that there seem to be an app for just about everything you can think of thanks to the openness of android And also Emulators for old consoles D  Moving from iPhone to android was relatively painless I opted to not use any transfer assistants and instead start with a blank slate with only the apps i need In day to day use it worked very well except for the bullet points listed at the end  The biggest annoyance is moving passwords If you use iCloud passwords like me its not possible to transfer that to google passwords or a password manager if you dont use a mac Instead you have to copy them one by one The positive is that if you opt for a 3rd party password manager the passwords will then be available on every device you ownOne other important thing to note is that there is apparently no good way to get iCloud calendar and reminders to sync with android This complicated things for me since i use these with my partner to plan our days and shopping if anyone has any tips here please let me knowHaving to buy apps and subscriptions again is also something to consider if you have invested a lot of money into the iOS system My biggest takeaways Positive  Good interface more fun than i expected to customize icons and look of the system I love the gestures Especially the ability to swipe back from the side of the screen this is something i will miss on my iPhone The ability to increase resolution to see more on the screen at the same time this makes the screen feel biggerNegative The keyboard is really inaccurate at least for my typing style it entered frequent spaces while typing and i just ended up with some annoying results I hope the keyboard is adaptive and i feel it might have gotten a little better after a while again if anyone has any tips they are welcome Android auto was slow and laggy I frequently experienced lag and slowness when changing songs in YouTube music and entering addresses in google maps a quick google says Im not alone in experiencing this so hopefully it gets fixed  Not a big issue It takes more work than it should be to change screen brightness and the auto brightness does not work well at allYesterday i put my SIM back in my iPhone mostly because of the top two negative points the issue with icloud sync and that many apps i use frequently only wants to be logged in to one device simultaneously The pixel will now be kept and used for its intended purpose as a secondarypersonal phone I have no issues recommending it and when my job pays for a new phone in October i will now also consider a flagship Android Hopefully they have added pixels to their list of approved phones so i can check out the pixel 9 pro dont really like the look of the Samsung UI","924":"I have a 24 Golf R and Im in the process of

malfunctioning MA1 I tried my Ottocast UX2  This thing emulates Apple Car Play to the car head unit side but for the phone it can emulate wireless Car Play for an iPhone or wireless AA for Android  It

Additionally I had replaced the back cover and accidentally disabled the NFC function in the processAnyway my new Pixel 9 surprised me by having only one speaker at the bottom The Pixel 6 had two speakers on both sides of the charging portWhen I first got the phone my initial thought was Why on earth would you replace the second speaker slot with a SIM card And today while watching YouTube I

really good built in autofocus If you can get a cheap pixel 6 where the cameras function for around 100 that is the best webcam you can get imo Only issue perhaps is that the phone can get hot

temperatures for you guys on Android Auto I recently upgraded from a P8 Pro to a Pixel 9 Pro and I havent noticed much difference when it comes to temperatures while using wired Android AutoAfter a 30minute drive with Google Maps running and Spotify playing in the background with downloaded songs on my phone in  60F weather with no sun my P9P greeted me with a battery temperature of 105FWhats the situation on your end Especially curious to hear from those who switched from other devices to the Pixel lineup Any noticeable improvements or similar issues","937":"I was a TMobile customer for years and then mint Finally left mint when Visible wireless had a 12 dollar deal for unlimited Long story short the Verizon network has been amazing and was loving it Got my pixel on the 22nd and talked with Visible wireless reps for hours and they could not find the IMEI Apparently this a thing with Pixels launches according to a quick search Confirmed the same issue existed with US Mobile but Verizon itself could see the phone just fine Such a disappointment Now with US mobiles dark star Just FYI in case you are thinking of switching  hope this gets fixed The phone itself is incredible coming from an iPhone 14 pro  Amazing screen Great camera AI is amazing so far great design and loving the software so far Apps like beeper and the navigation are great RCS is great Works like a charm I just have to deal with my wife complaining about the color green still lol However  I miss the while you were away notification newslike article apple provides putting on a glass protector has made

kept using my PW2 Recently I purchased Garmin Venu 3 because 1 I felt I never used any of the smartwatch features 2 For some odd reason PW does not support DnDsleep mode sync with any phones other than pixel phones 3 Short battery life At first I was very happy with the purchase and thought Id make the switch but when I saw the release and features of PW3 I decided to return the Garmin It is not because Garmin is a bad watch but PW 3 seems to fit my use case betterPros of the Garmin watch1 Fitnesssports focused If you take fitnesssports seriously especially running then you want to get a Garmin watch 100 There are plenty of reviews that show why Garmin is superior in every aspect in this regard2 Bigger screen I never had any issues with my PW2 screen size and never considered getting a larger watch  until I got the Garmin 45mm After using it I realized having a bigger screen is actually crucial for effectively using a smartwatch It is much better for viewing notifications at a glance using the apps and viewing any information in general I think the small screen of PW2 is the main reason why I used it so little3 Battery life The Garmin watch lasts about a week with the default settings Not having to think about charging two devices that you carry every day can be liberating4 Certain user experience This is the most baffling part of the PW2 Garmin a sportshardware focused company somehow provides better user experience than Google a softwaretech company  in certain areas For example as I stated before you cannot sync DnD between PW and your notpixel android phones PW also doesnt provide the functionality to set DnD schedule I cannot fathom how they think it is not a crucial feature for a smartwatch that every other brand has Garmin also shows your sleep stats and body battery score readiness score equivalent on your watch when you wake up In contrast with Pixel I have to first disable sleep mode otherwise it wont sync with the phone open the Fitbit app sync and then view my sleep statsreadiness score It is also easierquicker to startcontrol workouts with the Garmin Thankfully it appears that they finally provide some important QoL updates on the PW3 I especially think the auto DnD when you are asleep is a musthave feature for every smartwatch5 Body battery score Fitbit has a readiness score but it is nowhere as integrated and utilized as Garmins score Garmin provides tips and suggestion for your day and workout based on your score which is also shown directly on your watch Theres also sleep coaching that helps you to sleep better In this sense the Garmin watch feels smarter than the PW because it provides tips and guidance to you throughout the day at the right time whereas my experience with the PW is it is just a device that records your stats that you can view in the appNow aspects of Garmin that do not align with my use case that well1 Wallet feature This is probably the only smartwatch feature I frequently use However Garmin does not support Google wallet  as it is not a watchOS watch They still have Garmin Pay but it is a separate payment system that is not synced with your phone So you need to readd all your cards and tickets and passes in your Google Wallet wont be available on your watch Im also less confident on the availability of Garmin Pay2 Sleep tracking Garmin does a good enough job But after multiple sidebyside comparisons it seems to be less precise I also compared my Apple Watch 8 with my Garmin This is another confusing part according to The Quantified Scientist Apple Watch has the best sleep tracking and PW2 is close in the second But in my experience Apple Watchs builtin sleep tracking seems to be the worst It seems to heavily rely on the sleep schedule you set which unfortunately Im not following It way overestimates how much I sleep Even thirdparty iOS apps shows me results that are closer to reality Basically for my sleep tracking I rank PW2  Garmin  iPhone thirdparty apps  iPhone builtin tracking3 Smart features Unlike Garmins hardcore sport watches the Venu 3 is advertised as a lifestyle smartwatch so it is closer to a traditional smartwatch than a sport watch It is not as integrated with your phone as the other smartwatches which can be both a pro and a con You can use the Garmin with any phones you own and it functions more independently For some people it is exactly what they need For me I bring my phone with me all the times and Id prefer a bit more smart features and integration with my phone  Finally the price The Venu 3 costs 442 without discounted during Prime Day there was a big discount PW3 does not have that much of an advantage because it cost 400 Garmin will definitely retain its value better And all of Garmins current features do not require a subscription whereas you need Fitbit premium to access all features However if I trade in my PW2 it brings down the price by 220 which is a huge advantage Also considering the improvements of the PW3 seem to be the exact ones that PW2 needs I decided to stick with PW instead Hopefully 3 does not disappoint","940":"Dear Pixel PeopleI have a Pixel 7 Pro 256 GB With the

like that but wasnt fully satisfied with my research  I am currently a fairly happy owner of the Pixel 8 Pro but as there is a nice tradein and free Pixel Buds 2 Pro when buying the Pixel 9 Pro XL Im thinking of a change but there are some things Im not so sure about How does the 9 Pro XL feel in hand compared to the 8 Pro For context I HATE the sharp edges of such phones as the iPhone 13 Pro or Samsung S23 as I like to use my phone caseless Im bigger fan of curved 8 Pro but it can be slippery at some times  where would you guys place 9 Pro XL closer to S23 or 8 ProI found iPhone 13 Pro too heavy for me but that was because of the weight distribution Pixel 8 Pro feels really great in that matter hows the 9 Pro XLIs the battery life and heat management that much better on 9 Pro XL The only time I found 8 Pro uncomfortably hot was during summer 30 degrees outside or when using hotspot or Android Auto Thanks in advance","946":"I just got my new car from the garage very excited to be using AA since I have never had a car that supports it Now I cannot get AA to connect to my car Its a pixel 6a running android 14 The car is new software is up to date and the garage says he has seen similar issues with chinese branded phonesI am able to connect my phone to the car with bluetooth but when I start android auto on the car it asks to connect again with bluetooth It seems the bluetooth connection only works for calls and media I have tried to use an USB cable but I cannot even charge my phone with the USB cable and im also not sure the iX1 supports it since it specifically asks for a bluetooth connection I also get a notification on my phone Looking for Android AutoI tried everything

Windows 10 with a cableIve tried several cables C to C A to C and they work fine with my old OnePlus 8 Pro but not at all with my new Pixel 9 Pro Ive tried activating USB debugging as well but it didnt helpAnyone else having issues with this or is it just me The device isnt even displaying or anything only chargingOf course Ive also set to USB mode to File transferAndroid Auto but its not appearing in the file explorer on WindowsEDIT I managed to fix it myself by uninstalling the device including the driver which was listed under Samsung Phone in the device manager and plugging it back in again","948":"Ive had the privilege of owning an Iphone a Samsung and a Pixel I started using the Pixel 8 since the start of the year and my experience over the past nine months has been really frustrating Somehow I feel like this sentiment was not really captured by most of the Pixels reviewers which led me to feel like I had been somewhat misled by all the marketing and hype So Ill try to provide some alternative end user perspective that you should know before you jump in and buy the next generation of Google phonesSometimes the phone will just freeze for about 10 seconds This happens when the screen is locked and no amount of tapping or pressing of buttons will unlock This usually happens when notifications come in and you are texting and locking your phone and just as the screen locks another notification comes in You know it comes in because the phone vibrates but after that the screen just remains black and unresponsive It also happens when the screen is unlocked Applications will freeze randomly as if the processor just suddenly quit Or apps will suddenly close Sometimes the phone screen lags by several seconds and does not handle touches correctly I mean this may be a software issue but it really spoils the experience and for a brand new flagship phone it is so disappointingSecond Google photos is a bad photo viewer There is really no good alternative on the market to Samsungs gallery app or the iPhones Photos The scrubbing on videos is very inaccurate hard to select a particular frame They keep trying to get me to pick a better shot even when I dont want them and so I have to click that notification away repeatedly and there is no way to turn it offWhen i edit a photo I have to save as a copy there is no option to directly overwrite the file Annoying on so many occasions  when I want to take something quick and crop it for some unimportant task I end up with two separate photosThird there is no convenient app drawer or something similar to Samsung edge panels It seems like a downgrade in terms of productivity and ease of access compared to Samsung and AppleFourth inferior battery Not a very new complaint but you will definitely feel its effects Falls by maybe 30 after 5 hours of light use After a full day of work 86 and post work event less than 10 left A couple of times my battery suddenly shows a question mark sign which is not what I was expecting from less than one year old phoneFifth the refresh rate is not as advertised for many many apps Telegram reddit all have noticable jitter when rapid scrolling Its not smooth and not a nice feelingSixth Google voice recordings are so hard to access They get stored in some folder that requires root permissions The only way to transfer them is to share through the share button in the app itselfThe hardware problems I can overlook but many of these issues seem to be software issues You cant push the blame to anyone else and say that its a problem with Android or the software Absolutely deplorable for a software company I regret purchasing this about 80 worse than that time I bought toedsocksWhats up with the Auto HDR dimming When photos with HDR are detected on screen the phone will automatically adjust the brightness to make the photos pop The effect actually just throws people off instead I think it makes the display look unnatural all around The whites are too bright almost blinding and everything else is so mutedLast generic USB type A charging blocks just suck at charging the pixel Its almost as if it recognises this and automatically throttles the charging speed Most dont even charge it fast enough to keep the battery from draining You need a USB C to USB C cable and charger which basically means you cant charge it in public  in hotels at airports on trains which all have USB A output portsThe final straw that pushed me to write this review was the screen suddenly turning green intermittently Clearly theres something loose there in the display There was no knock or drop of the phone and I have been treating it very carefully I would not be surprised if it happened to an older phone but this unit is not even a year old","949":"Hi

primarily use Fido via eSIM I had to drive into the USA for a few days and for the trip I purchased a oneweek 1 GB data eSIM from Airalo which is something I have done multiple times in the past albeit on my older phone Pixel 4a Whenever I use the Airalo eSIM I keep my Canadian eSIM active at the same time so that I can receive SMS if need be for things like twofactor authenticationI use an AAWireless adapter as my car Kia EV6 does not come with wireless AA from the factorySequence of events1 While in Canada turned on Airalo eSIM and enabled automatic data switching so that the phone would retain its LTE connection as soon as I crossed the border2 Drove about an hour to the first stop Realized one of my passengers had not purchased a US data plan so I turned on my Pixel 8s hotspot for them which prevented me from using the AAWireless adapter No biggie  I replaced the adapter with a USBc to USBA cable that I always keep in the car and continued to use AA in wired mode3 Stopped two hours later to charge my car Got out to use the restroom so I disconnected my Pixel 8 from the car Got back into the car and the phone simply refused to start Android Auto The Kias infotainment screen would pop up the message Phone is not responding every time I plugged in the cable The phones screen would flash white for a fraction of a second as well If I pressed the apps switcher button on the phones navbar I use the old 3button navbar layout Android Auto would appear in the recent apps but if I tried to select Android Auto from that view it would exit back to the home screen   1 I tried restarting the phone clearing cachedata for Android Auto and Google Play Services deleting and recreating the Bluetooth connection with the Kia etc and nothing worked Luckily I carried my old phone in my backpack as backup so I connected it to my Pixel 8 hotspot and managed to use AA on that phone with the USB cable connected At least this ruled out the cars USB port or the cable as root causes4 Over the next three days I searched Reddit Google forums XDA etc and tried all kinds of things that didnt involve factoryresetting my Pixel 8 I reset Bluetoothwifi settings had the side effect of forcing me to reset and repair my Pixel Watch I went to Developer Options and played with every permutation of the Bluetooth AVRCP and MAP versions I tried uninstalling all updates to the Android Auto app Absolutely nothing Extremely frustrating  thankfully I still had my Pixel 4a which I continued to use over these three days in the USA5 Drove back to Canada and deleted the Airalo eSIM as I no longer need it I then realized that one thing I hadnt tried earlier was shutting off one of my SIMs so I attempted to connect my Pixel 8 to Android Auto again using the USB cable It still didnt work Then I cleared the datacache on Android Auto restarted the phone and lo and behold  Android Auto was fixed I also successfully repaired it with my AAWireless adapterIt seems like it was the dual eSIMs that broke Android Auto but Im not 100 certain Unfortunately I did not capture any bug reports to help prove or disprove this Whatever it was its definitely specific to the Pixel 8 andor Android 14 because I did not encounter this issue when using my Pixel 4a with Android 13 even when I had an Airalo eSIM active simultaneously with a Canadian physical SIM","952":"I currently have the Pixel 7 Pro and with the deals floating around from my phone provider and the absolute POS replacement they just sent I have definitely been thinking about getting the Pixel 9 Pro This is where Im stuckI have

replacement due to my mom backing over it with her car lol The second needed replaced due to the replacement not holding a charge And the third came when when the last stopped charging The replacements were refurbished phones That brings me to where I sit with 3 that also needs replaced It dies at 4050 and can only be turned back on when its plugged in If it is under that 40ish mark when plugged in it will just flash the Google logo over and over until its ready to boot I can not boot it up myself it just starts when it wants It also regularly rejects the SIM card and I had to make a poor Verizon tech sit with it for 2 hours when it was activated because it did not want to accept a SIM card Keep in mind Ive owned this phone for under 2 weeks so Im a little frustratedBattery the battery life on these phones is mediocre at best I noticed the second one had a horrible battery life compared to 1 and 3 if you take out 3s obvious issues The battery on all of them also getsgot uncomfortably hot with regular use and I often find myself leaving it somewhere cool to take a little breakAndroid auto I have tried several of these phones cords and vehicles to try and get this

disappear randomly but the on that has the most issues is the weather One day its there the next its gone It always come back eventually but I would like to know where it goesNow obviously Ive had my fair share of issues with these phones but there are things that I do really enjoy and I would definitely like to consider the Google Pixel 9 as my next investment Any insight both good and bad is

other Android skins have cool features OnePlus being able to force Google Maps at 120hz makes me way more excited than it shouldMy Pixel also just gets unbelievably hot The Tensor chips are too toasty

completely refused to connect for a couple days and then at one point yesterday I got in the car while on a phone call and it connected immediately And then this morning it stopped connecting again So naturally I tried starting it up while on a phone call again and it doesnt help Voodoo Sometimes my phone says continue on your car screen but the AA icon doesnt show up on the car screen Sometimes my phone says its already connected to AA but its notIve tried connecting the phone directly via usb and then switching to the MA1 and that sometimes works but usually doesnt Ive tried turning bluetooth on and off which sometimes works and usually doesnt Ive tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling Android Auto with the same inconsistent results clearing Android Autos cache clearing Bluetooth cache etc Ive tried repairing the phone to the MA1 with the same inconsistent results Ive tried briefly pressing the button on the MA1 in the vain hope that its some sort of voodoo that will make it work and that never helps I tried factory resetting the MA1 once and I think that worked but I dont want to do that every time it gets flaky like thisI feel like Im in a cargo cult and whether or not it connects has nothing to do with all these things Im doing its just that coincidentally sometimes I do something and it connects so I think that what I just did must be the solutionWhen it DOES connect it stays connected without any problems usually for several days although sometimes only until I turn off the car Today it wouldnt connect and then suddenly connected a full 5 minutes after I started driving and then wouldnt connect again the rest of the dayAnd of course it doesnt help matters that there are three potential points of failure here my phone the MA1 and the car and I have no

drive long distances and I have been charging my phone while I driveI am unsure if this is a coincidence given how old my phone is if Android Auto is the culprit or if Android Auto is a catalystI

loved what now feels like the vintage Android Wear experience they offered I eventually switched to a Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 after the charging ring on my Gen 6 watch broke and Fossil later announced they were pulling out of the smartwatch game I thought going for the first Wear OS 3 watch would give me a similar experience but forgot how much Samsung loves to change for the sake of change and how insistent they are on forcing their own apps onto you including Samsung Pay which isnt compatible with some of the banks I use Ive also briefly used TicWatch Pro 3 and TicWatch Pro 5 over these last few years but have returned them after a while because of problems with the strapsI was excited for the release of the Google Pixel Watch 3 but Im surprised that its been a far from perfect experience I thought other people who are considering a purchase might want to read some of the design decisions taken by Google that have detracted from my enjoyment of the device The demo Pixel watches in stores are all dumbed down watches with a very restricted OS Many of the apps are just preprogrammed videolike sequences that you cant interact with and so the watches dont let you explore any of the menu options in any meaningful way so you cant really explore the watch and see what its going to be like before you spend the money on it Google Fit is now entirely replaced by default by the Fitbit app which in itself isnt a bad thing but the Fitbit app is lacking some configurability options that really would improve quality of life The most glaring of these is the Fitbit app on the watch that when opened greets you with a list of information cards that cannot be changed in any way The fixed order of these is Cardio load Readiness Steps Floors Distance Calories burned Active zone minutes Exercise days Hourly activity Heart rate Resting heart rate Sleep Blood oxygen during sleep Skin temp variation Body responses and Mindfulness There is a settings option in the Fitbit app on the watch  the only option here is to sign out The cards on the Fitbit app for phone can be reordered but only in batches by category Individual cards can be turned on and off in the phone app only The Pixel Watch app for my phone that was used to set up the watch is in perpetual dark mode but the Fitbit app that you will switch to during this setup process still hasnt gained a dark mode and will blind you if you were enjoying the dark mode of the Watch app There are no options to configure heart rate tracking oxygen saturation or any aspect of sleep tracking  these are all on by default and at the level of tracking that Google has deemed These options cannot be turned off at all Im very glad to see some very dataheavy watch faces that can accommodate eight complications much like on the Apple Watch However they are all very monochromatic affairs Colours can be changed but it changes the colour for everything and so even though the quality of the screen is top notch its wasted on these watch faces which end up being a series of hued text on an OLED black background I would like the option here to see some additional colours on the included watch faces  the Apple Watch has a bit of colour in the icons and dials for some of the complications as do several in the Google Play Store Live heart rate data can only be seen from the watch face from a tile or from the card on the home screen of the Fitbit app on the watch after scrolling down most of the way Opening the heart rate info in the Fitbit app  on watch or phone  does not provide any live heart rate information There is still no option to check your oxygen saturation levels ad hoc this only happens during sleep And it happens during sleep whether you want it to or not since there is no option for configuring this The auto display brightness feature is good but in dark environments is too dark even on the highest setting The watch can automatically enter DNDbedtime mode when it detects that youve fallen asleep but again there is no option to configure what this mode actually does so its all or nothing including screen off The option to sync this with your phone existed with previous Pixel watches but is noticeably absent this time round The watchs automatic exercise tracking is a bit of a con It asks you after a minimum period of time has passed if you want to track the activity and no GPS information will be saved prior to this question being asked The time period cant be shortened to less than 10 minutes in the Fitbit app on the phoneIm annoyed by some of the items in this list because they are features that are present on Samsung and TicWatch watches and Im surprised that Google hasnt included them in their flagship device when other manufacturers are able to","965":"Hi all Im trying to connect my pixel 8 Pro to a Mercedes GLC which supports Android auto Im connecting to the right port and the phone will charge but Android auto isnt starting Ive set setting to connect

and it goes into file transfer mode pretty easily but after just a few minutes of transferring files Windows Explorer completely freezes up and it stops transferring The only thing that solves and unfreezes it is to unplug the phone and plug it back inIts very annoying to have to transfer 2040 files at a time because once it freezes up even if I cutandpaste it does not remove any of the files on my phone so I dont know which one its transferred over or notDoes anyone know what I can do Ive tried different cables and a different computer along with restarting the phone but Im still running into the same problem It connects without problems otherwise its whenever it transfers files for more than a minute or two it stops and freezes up the computerRunning Windows 11 on my PC and Android 14 on the Pixel The USB settings state that its controlled by the phone and USB is used for File TransferAndroid Auto Im not doing anything else on the computer or on the phone while transferring filesEDIT I dont know if this is related but it also seems to freeze up if I delete one single file If I delete two its usually fine but if I delete just one it freezes up","967":"Ive used wireless

connected but the watch causes an issue for the announcement to come through the headphones This also happens with Android auto With Android auto The watch rings load but Android audio ring goes low through the car speakers The only way to stop this from happening is to turn off phone calls under the Pixel watch Bluetooth settings Now you cant make phone calls from the watch If the headphones are connected to the phone the announcement should come through the headphones Is there a way to fix this issue I have an apple watch and this doesnt happen at all If you use carplay even with the watch

not connect to bluetooth and handsfree voice will not work for that to work the only solution I found is rebooting the phone that instantly fixes it until next time it happensI had a pixel 7a before

to activate your free year of Gemini Advancedits like having ChatGPT that can also control your phone home automation and everything around you6 I was surprised at how many of my existing smart home products support Google Home Almost 12 of my devices werent compatible with Apple now most are7 Get the 256GB version if you can I got the 128GB because the 256GB had a longer wait time but its filling up fast The extra space is worth it8 Android Auto has grown on me and I now prefer it to CarPlay because its more customizable The main menu can still be a bit laggy but its smooth everywhere else Features like pinchtozoom on maps support for notifications from lot more apps and a more customizable interface make it feel more advanced9 Apple Music works great in the Android ecosystem and Im keeping it Lossless audio sounds fantastic especially since Android supports highres Bluetooth codecs that iPhones dont Its a great experience overall10 USBC is pretty much everywhere now especially since iPhones have adopted it too Its awesome having just one cable for everythingyour phone laptop and more especially when youre traveling11 The latest generation of Android Wear watches is excellent Dont bother with lastgen models the improvements in performance and battery life make a huge difference No more lagfest on my Galaxy Watch 712 Photos on Pixel usually looks better with vibrant colors that pop although iPhones sometimes capture more realistic colors and better dynamic range Videos especially when switching between lenses arent as smooth as iPhones but still hold up

like Robinhood Kia Access and ClickUp work even better on Android though some like X Twitter still lag behind15 I switched back to Android after years with iOS iPhone 14 Pro  Pixel 9 Pro XL I was an early Android fan from the MyTouch 3G days and even used to be active as a developer in the modding scene I left because of the jankiness and unreliability but things have changed Google is marching

tried stock android 14 with the latest updates and Ive tried android 15 qpr 1 beta 2 since it has a lot of Bluetooth fixes in the patch notes but the issue persists Any idea what could be going on ","979":"Currently been using the Pixel Pro 9 for a week after having been in IOS for 10 years iPhone 13PM This would be the most basic review and all comparisonsthings said are just my opinions The phone is greatly designed The circular camera at the front is noticable but only bc Im used to the 13PMs bezzle The back camera bump is unique and different I feel refreshing to see another design besides Apples and Samsungs I am rocking the 9 Pro XL in hazel and i really dig the color Saw obsidian at my local best buy but hazel was different and subtle The phones build is in my opinion the best looking pixel that looks and feels premium But that can also be just bc of its resemblance to the iPhone that have been looking at for the past 10yearsScreen looks slower and not as fluid as my 13PM It wouldnt be a big deal to me if this phone wasnt 3 years newer than my 13PM so it kinda rubs me the wrong way knowing that the screen on my 13 PM is as good as the Pixel pro 9 Auto dimmer can make the screen a bit too dark for me at times But that is a whole other issueModem is alright I work in a building with 4 floors and Im in the 3rd Calls and messages are great Social media and Internet usage can be a bit delayed Alot of people say that its a big upgrade but I feel that my iPhone was able to get me signal from most places including my 3rd floor office Watching videos on social media lags out a bit at times Idk if its a user error but when on X and watching videos they lag or just stop I have to press play and the video plays for 12 seconds then stops again I just close the app I havent tried looking for a real solution bc frankly I can careless Battery life i am still determining just bc I have had the phone for a week so it is still adjusting to my habits and battery usage But for the first weeks its been alright Im a dad I start my day at 430 am and end it around 910 pm From 430 to 7am Im getting up and going to the gym by 7am my phone was at 90 starting from a full charge By 1 pm my phone is at 55 with just using it for texting my wife light scrolling and playing musicpodcasts in the background So compared to my 13 PM the battery has been weaker But like I said Pixel is still adjusting to my battery usage Camera is alright Some pictures look better and others look better on the 13PM Various of the new upgrades that are AI based are in early stages Doesnt really catch my attention and due to them being early stage roll outs they dont make it into a considerations of an upgrade Magic eraser isnt new but it works alright Pixel studio is cool and I get the idea but it seems like iOS will be having somethings similar Video is def better on the 13PM Just cant argue that one lol camera is good pretty good overall  especially if your camera isnt the buying point Android software is cool very customizable and open to work with Def better than IOSProbably a bunch of other things I havent mentioned but its just a small glimpse to the phoneOverall I think its a great phone but IDK if its worth upgrading FOR ME just bc I dont feel like most of the upgrades are not really full on upgrades","980":"title  how can i fix
