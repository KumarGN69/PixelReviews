go out and buy a new piece of tech every day like all of my favorite YouTubers There has to be research involvedI need to know what Im buying will keep me happy for longer than the 14 day return period So with 3 topend phones in my crosshairs the iPhone X the Pixel 2XL and the Note 8 I drudged through pages and pages of reddit reviews watched hours of video commentary and came to one conclusion I have no idea what phone to buy so why not try out all 3 Since Im a man of limited means Id have to try them out one at a time I started the upgrade process on my account and set my sights on the first prize the iPhone X  Xtra screen Xtra priceyThe iPhone X is arguably the most beautiful slab of glass and stainless steel Ive ever held in my hands The weight of the phone lets you know youve spent money on something well built I felt like when I had this thing out showing it off I was the center of attentionusually because I was It is a near perfect monument of what the path to the perfect iPhone has been for Apple The screen alone almost makes the phone worth it with its vivid punchy colors and amazing brightness The screen almost looks TOO good Like you can reach in and touch the icons The notch while noticeable for about 3 minutes just melts away I only noticed it when a video zoomed in past its pillar boxes Even then the notch didnt seem to upset me What did upset me was learning the gestures Some of them make sense swiping up from the bottom to close an app for instance But others like getting to the background apps felt slow and clunky And getting to the control center should be easier than it is Its not a one handed operation but I really feel it should be Sure if you have big hands like I do you can stretch your thumb out But if you have small hands its not going to be easy What made iOS great in the past was its simplicity and intuitiveness All of that seems to have been forgotten with the X and iOS 11 What has stayed simple though is Apples top notch bio metricsFaceID sounds like a bigger gimmick than square hamburger patties at Wendys I mean Android has had this for years right Wrong FaceID was easy to set up and quick to unlock The amazing subtle features that come with FaceID like hiding notifications on the lock screen until the phone recognizes you is just amazing I liked that I didnt have to position my face in some weird pose or angle for it to work either It just worked and thats what Apple people know and love Animojiswhile an even bigger gimmick were fun to play around with and really showcases what that front camera is capable of Speaking of Cameras both cameras did great the pics looked decently colored and I really love iOSs live photos with 3D touch Its about the only thing I used 3D touch for and its done well The video recording was very well done with 4k  60FPS being its biggest highlight The only thing I thought that wasnt well done was the OISto be honest I had to double check to make sure the phone HAD OIS because it didnt feel like it Hopefully that gets fixed in a software update Overall though the cameras can hold their own with the best that Android has to offer However after using the phone for a little bit I really felt cheated I was not seeing the smooth as silk iOS I had been told of for many years I was not getting top of the line battery life from a 1100 phone And as an android user for the last 6 years things just felt clunky navigating around the OS I missed things Ive taken for granted for years like my notifications with LEDs AOD and setting my own default apps Some of these things I could get adjusted to and I realize iOS 11 is going through a rough patch But all in all it just wasnt feeling like I could justify purchasing the X and telling myself to adapt to my phone instead of my phone adapting to meLets go back to the Android basics 2 XL styleBeing on ATT I couldnt just go into the store and subsidize a Pixel 2 XL That alone bugs me I HATE carrier exclusive phones Yes I know I can buy the phone direct from Google and thats good But theres something nice about going to a carrier store picking up the phone you want right there and walking out paying only sales tax with a big bill later Lucky for me one of my friends owns a shiney new Pixel 2 XL and let me play with it for a day Holy bananas this phone is snappyno snappy isnt good enough Its itsGoogle needs to invent a new word for how fast this phone feels Ive been on the Samsung train for most of my Android life with the Oneone and the Nexus 6 being the only two exceptions I honestly thought that the whole skipping frames and sluggishness you read about on the I hate Samsung train that is rAndroid was a bunch of nonsense Even my S7Edge felt fine to me No real slowdowns or anything Nope I was wrong WAAAAAY wrong The Pixel 2 XL felt like I had stepped out of a Toyota Corolla and into a Ferrari My friend laughed as I scrolled through the app drawer for minutes just saying its sooo smooth  From one Samsung fanboy to the rest of you out there your phone is slow you just dont realize it The camera was the other area this phone just steps out into its own I could not get it to take a bad photo to save my life Putting it against my other coworkers iPhone 8 she was even blown away by how the photos looked just like real life I briefly tried out the video functionality and cannot figure out how this camera manages to make better videos than phones with dual lens setups and OIS on everything except the user itself My only complaint about the camera was I didnt have a lot of shooting mode options Everything was very basic with just a couple of modes Google keeping it simple for the user definitely works for a lot of people but I do like having options like a manual modeThe Pixel 2s biggest controversy since its release is its less than stellar screen Once again coming from Samsung and even playing with the iPhone X I think Im a pretty good judge  when it comes to OLED displays I have almost nothing bad to say about the 2 XLs display The blueshift on the phone I tested didnt stand out to me as anything bad and really felt overblown especially when looking at other OLEDs I checked for light bleed and didnt see any And while my friends 2 XL is only a week old I didnt see any burn in or image retention but he does keep the brightness in check so as to not suffer the wrath of the burn in gods  Speaking of brightness this seems to be my only gripe with the screen At max brightness it just barely seemed to hang in there especially in direct sunlight While I could see what was on screen dark colors just merged together and details cant stand out Out of the 3 phones I tested this was by far the darkest screen Its great for indoors but I wasnt overly thrilled taking it outside   Now I fully admit I dont get the religious Pure Android or nothing attitude I see on Reddit I think OEM skins arent just nice but vital to forcing Google to incorporate the best of each skin into new iterations of Android AOD Multiapp display and a ton of other features in Android are thanks to LG Samsung and all the others out there pushing the limits of their vision of Android  That being said simple Android is pretty easy to use and Id even argue maybe even easier to use than iOS lately After tinkering with the 2 XL I can definitely see the appeal but I do and always will love feature rich skins that provide users with an even more engrossing and productive experience A noteworthy experience but can it lastMy final phone tested was the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 This phone is so big I had to get permits from the city just to let me put it in my house I kid but while expensive the Note 8 will at least leave you with the feeling you got a LOT for your money And you really do too That pen just keeps getting smarter every iteration of the Note line With it being able to do text translations and live messaging its a gimmick feature that I kept finding myself going back to I was looking for excuses to pull out the pen and do new things on the screenthat gorgeous beautiful screen Picasso once said Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot others transform a yellow spot into the sun Samsung has managed to create not another copy of an OLED display but THE OLED display for others to copy What the Note 8 lacks in fluidity and it does it makes up for in the most stunning display and feature rich experience in all of the 3 phones I tested From app pairing to cutting out sections of the screen drawing notes and then texting them faster than it took for me to write this sentence the Note 8 has abilities that would make a swiss army knife blush I was finding new things to do with the phone every time I picked it up Its almost overwhelming And therein lies the problem with Samsung vs Android purists Samsung weighs itself down with a constant influx of features at the expense of ram and processing power THANKFULLY Im happy to say that the Note 8 experience was a smooth one Not NEARLY as smooth as the Pixel 2 XL but Samsung has made ungodly strides in improving performance and it shows in the Note 8 Thats not to say there werent the occasional frame drop here and there now that I know what to look for with my Pixel experience I can hear what youre thinking Smooth now but give it a month or two and I would agree with you My Galaxy S6 was probably the worst offender in recent memory However I was able to compare the new Note 8 in my hand to another coworkers Note 8 theyve had since launch Everything seemed to be identical in terms of smoothness and the benchmarks were practically the same I tried to break both phones bogging them down with running apps music and video But to my surprise both phones held steady What didnt hold steady was the battery life I found it to be just barely ok I think that with quick charge we are becoming accustomed to fast charging top offs at the expense of sub par battery life Samsung really needs to address this in the next Note phone because a productivity phone that you use during the work day SHOULD be able to get you through the work day without the feeling of panic by 2 PM I hope Samsung shakes off the PTSD they gained from the Note 7 disaster We need battery innovation and the Note 8 is a great example of why Camera wise the Note 8 took great photos for a normal guy like myself But the iPhone X did a  better job and the 2 XL blew both of them out of the water The one area I felt the Note 8 shined over the other 2 was in video recording The image stabilization was excellent on the Note as well as the recorded sound quality While the iPhone Xs recorded sound was very quiet and the 2 XLs was very tinny the Note 8 had a very good balance of audio quality and ambient noise reduction This surprised me since I didnt think Samsung cared about sound because the Note comes with a single bottom firing speakerits 2017 Samsung stereo speakers are a thing Im sorry for yelling Samsungplease dont kill off the headphone jack Ok OkTLDR what did I pick While beautiful I couldnt get myself used to the Apple ecosystem so the X was out The 2 XL cant be purchasedsubsidized through ATTs Next program and I refuse to switch to Verizon so that was out Which leaves me with the Note 8 I loved all three phones for plenty of reasons and you CANT go wrong with any of them The iPhone X is a beautifulBEAUTIFUL work of art the Pixel 2 XL is a purist dream come true that is faster than any phone Ive ever played with and the Note 8 is a treasure trove of features and a display that will melt your eyes with its beauty  I count myself lucky to live in an age of these beautiful devices and am fortunate to be able to own one EDIT Thank you so much for the goldEDIT2 Fixed spelling errors and carrier skins to OEM skins  thanks uexelero88","9":"So Im watching the Super Bowl with 15 iPhone users and they were all glued to the TV during the Pixel commercial

rGooglePixel Im Mishaal Rahman You may know me as the guy who wrote that absurdly long Android 13 changelog articlehttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdive or as the former EditorinChief of XDADevelopers Im here because Android 13 will soon be released and I figured not everyone here is clued in about whats included in the update If you have a Pixel 4 or later youll have plenty of opportunity to play around with it soon if you havent already enrolled in the beta If you want a summary of what features to look out for though Ive got you coveredBelow youll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think Pixel users like you should be aware of Ill start out by listing 10 features that will likely only be used by Pixels current and future or at the very least will arrive first on Pixel followed by 50 features that should be common across Android 13 devices Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details but Ill also provide a summary under each item for a quick tldr For the 50 nonPixelexclusive Android features Ive roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features and yes you may not care about everything in the list Still theres a lot thats new in the Android 13 update so I hope you find a few things youre excited aboutWithout further ado heres my list1 Cinematic wallpapershttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivecinematicwallpapers In Android 13 DP2 I discovered strings within the WallpaperPicker app that suggest youll be able to make your photo a 3D wallpaper that moves when your phone moves The Android System Intelligence app is hinted at being as the systems wallpaper effects generation service ie itll be what actually turns photos into 3D wallpapers Keep in mind this feature isnt available yet and it could never launch This could be something Google is holding off until the Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel Tablet launch2 Resolution switchinghttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdiveresolutionswitching Pixel devices have never had a way to switch between FHD and QHD resolution on devices where that might make sense like the XLPro models with QHD panels Android 13 however adds screen resolution settings that appear whenever a FHD and QHD display mode are exposed to Android No Pixels right now do that but there are rumors that the Pixel 7 Pros panel will support FHD as well as QHD The reason Slightly better battery life when running graphically intensive apps Heres a screenshot of what the page will look likehttpsi0wpcomblogesperiowpcontentuploads202204Android13screenresolutionsettingspngresize5402C1170ssl13 Hub modehttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivehubmode Android 13 is preparing a hub mode feature that will let users access apps across profiles Right now if you want to access an app from another profile you have to switch to that profile With hub mode youd be able to access them from say the ambient display Theres not a lot thats known about this feature and it could have been pushed back to a future release but Im thinking its aimed at shared devices like what the upcoming Pixel Tablet seems to be ie a hybrid of a Nest Hub  an Android tablet Heres a screenshot of the trusted network settings for Hub modehttpsi0wpcomblogesperiowpcontentuploads202204Android13hubmodesettingspngw613ssl1 Anotherhttpsi0wpcomblogesperiowpcontentuploads202204Android13hubmodetrustednetworkspngw613ssl14 Screen saver revamphttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivescreensaverrevamp Another feature thats likely aimed at the Pixel Tablet but also other shareddockable devices is the revamped screen saver experience in Android 13 You probably wont see this on your phone ever but Android 13 can show complications yes like the watch kind on top of screen savers There are complications for air quality cast info datetime and weather Heres a screenshot of the complications togglehttpsi0wpcomblogesperiowpcontentuploads202204Android13complicationstoggleinscreensaversettingspngw598ssl1 and some complications showing on the Colors screen

adds support for Media Tap To Transfer a feature that will let you send media from one device like a smartphone to another like a tablet The actual media transfer will likely be handled by Google Play Services and Im guessing this feature could debut with the Pixel Tablet Despite its name the transfer protocol could be NFC Bluetooth UWB or something else6 Multiple Enabled Profiles on a single eSIMhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivemultipleenabledprofiles Want to ditch your physical SIM card Android 13 adds support for eSIM MEP or Multiple Enabled Profiles to let you simultaneously use two or more SIM profiles stored on a single eSIM chip I dont know which Pixels will support this sadly7 Virtualization supporthttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivevirtualization This one is really complicated but basically Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature pKVM to be precise as the hypervisor with crosvm as the virtual machine manager Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose isolated compilation but devs have figured out how to boot Linux and even Windows VMshttpsblogesperioandroiddessertbites13virtualizationonpixel6379185 with it Youll need a device that supports pKVM like the Pixel 6 6 Pro and I think 6a 8 exFAT supporthttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdiveexfat You can finally mount an exFAT drive if you have a Pixel 6 6 Pro or 6a This only works on Pixels with Linux 510 but as for why it also requires Android 13 the reason is kind of sillyhttpsblogesperioandroiddessertbites27exfatonpixel5321768499 Ambient Context eventshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdiveambientcontext You know how the Nest Hub can detect your coughing or snoring Remember the rumorhttps9to5googlecom20220526pixelandroidsnoredetection about Google adding builtin snoringcough detection for Pixel That will likely make use of Android 13s Ambient Context API Theres already a hinthttpstwittercomMishaalRahmanstatus1530017887854813184 that Digital Wellbeing will make use of the API10 Crossdevice callinghttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivecrossdevicecalling When the Pixel Tablet comes out Im sure youll want a way to take a phone call on it when your phone isnt on you Through Android 13s crossdevice calling API this could be possible11 Runtime permission for notificationshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivenotificationpermission Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not its newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13 but this generally makes notifications optin rather than optout Examplehttpsi0wpcomblogesperiowpcontentuploads202204Android13runtimepermissionfornotificationspngw598ssl112 New Material You dynamic color styleshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivematerialyoustyles Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Googles dynamic color engine which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values By adjusting these values the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes ie styles tldr Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style Examples TONALSPOT

Although Googles dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12 it was added to AOSP in Android 12Lhttpsblogesperioandroid12ldeepdiveandroid12ldynamiccolorsaosp and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do13 Themed Iconshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivethemedicons The colors generated by Androids dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as inapp UI elements If you enable the themed icons option in Wallpaper  Style the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the users wallpaper Beforehttpsi0wpcomblogesperiowpcontentuploads202204ThemediconsdisabledinAndroid13pngw613ssl1 versus

UIhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivemediacontrolsplaybackstate Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13 This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls this is what theyre referring

active app button in the notifications panel Tap this and youll see which apps currently have a foreground service running For example music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground

improvementshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivefpsintervention When a game hasnt added support for the Game Mode API OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games In Android

static spatial audio where the sound seems to move as your head moves and dynamic spatial audio where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves Static spatial audio works with any headphones

cracking down on apps misusing APIs and in Android 13 youll be blocked from enabling an apps Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store There

permissionshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivemediafilepermissions Scoped Storage changed how apps access fileshttpsblogesperiohowscopedstorageworks making it so that the READEXTERNALSTORAGE permission doesnt grant broad access to the external shared storage Instead it only let apps access media files including audio video and image files owned by other apps that reside in media store collections In Android 13 apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files video files or image files owned by other apps making media file access even more granular40 Revamped multiuser UIhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivetableofcontentstextSquiggly20progress20barMultiuserFullscreen20user20profile Theres a couple of enhancements to the multiuser experience in

Android 1344 Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in splitscreenhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivedraglaunchmultiinstancesplitscreen Android 12 added multiinstance support making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity For example you can launch two Chrome windows in splitscreen mode Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in splitscreen view provided the activity supports it45 Take away an apps ability to turn on the screenhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdiveturnscreenonpermission Theres a new turn screen on permission that you can control in Settings  Apps  Special app access Its quite selfexplanatory Heres a screenshot of the permission pagehttpsi0wpcomblogesperiowpcontentuploads202205Android13turnscreenonpermissionpagepngw613ssl146 Control background access of body sensorshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivebackgroundbodysensors Apps can access data from heart rate temperature and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODYSENSORS permission Prior to Android 13 apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODYSENSORSBACKGROUND47 Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi deviceshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivenearbywifidevices Its possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and WiFi devices over time which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and WiFi scan results That got annoying and confusing for users so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission Android 13 follows up by decoupling WiFi scanning from location permissions48 Camera2 improvementshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivecamera2improvements Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps and its getting some welcome additions in Android 13 First it has added HDR video capture supporthttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivecamera2hdrvideo so thirdparty camera apps can finally capture HDR video provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL Theres a new API for preview stabilization and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well These are more developerfocused improvements but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a thirdparty camera app49 Faster hyphenationhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivefasterhyphenation Text wrapping will be better in Android 13 as

wrappinghttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivejapanesetextwrapping Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by Bunsetsu which is the smallest unit of words thats coherent instead of by character This will make text more readable by Japanese users51 Improved line heights for nonLatin scriptshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdiveimprovedlineheightsnonlatin Android 13 improves support for nonLatin scripts like Tamil Burmese Telugu and Tibetan The OS uses a line height thats adapted for each language preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters52 MIDI 20 supporthttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivemidi20 MIDI 20 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bidirectionality so devices can communicate with each other to autoconfigure themselves or exchance info on available functionality It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32bit resolution support53 DNSoverHTTP3 supporthttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivednsoverhttps Android 9 added encrypted DNS ie Private DNS support through the DNSoverTLS protocol Android 13 adds support for the DNSoverHTTP3 protocol This implementation offers better performance and security Right now Androids DNSoverHTTP3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 1112L and some Android 10 devices54 Androids Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline modulehttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivebluetoothmodule Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common so in an effort to improve security Android 13 turns Androids Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components However Im not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs55 Androids ultrawideband stack becomes a Mainline modulehttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdiveuwbmodule In a similar vein Androids ultrawide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13 There arent many devices yet with UWB hardware but with this  the new UWB Jetpack libraryhttpsdeveloperandroidcomjetpackandroidxreleasescoreuwb we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates56 Binary transparencyhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivebinarytransparency If you care about security then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match whats included in the official factory images Android 13s binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device so you can compare them with the official images Note that while Googles the only one doing this so far AFAIK theres nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs57 Dynamic System Updates become a lot fasterhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivedsuimprovements Dynamic System Updates DSU makes it easy to install a Generic System Image GSI without overwriting your devices original installation or wiping your data All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer

faster runtime performancehttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdiveartupdates An update to the Android Runtime ART module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linuxs userfaultd feature

menu when I disable phone calls Surely thats not an intentional feature what could possibly be the purposeI googled and saw some people complaining about the same thing Apparently for some people the issue started when they upgraded to Android 10 didnt happen in Android 9 But I couldnt find any explanation or solutionOn a side note I saw some people mention a setting for showing Bluetooth battery percent in the notification bar How do I do that is it possible without a third party appMy previous phone was a Note 8 and upgrades ended at Android 9 so Ive  never used Android 1012 Was there some progression and regression of features I missed out on","33":"I have a pixel 7 and Im using the Huawei freebuds pro 2 and its been great cristal clear sound top noise cancelling and awareness modes Im

Razer Blade Stealth 2016 Intel i76500U  8GB RAM  256GB SSD  1440p display I bought this refurbished from Razer in 2017 Ive gotten the screen replaced since then I honestly havent used it for much since buying it just some light schoolwork here and there but Ive been using my desktop for most of my work In total Ive paid 1700 for the unit and repairs There are light cosmetic issues on three corners but other than that its in tiptop shape Includes stock 45 watt charger iPhone 6 Plus 64GB I bought this from a friend who kept it well but after using it for a month it go the touch disease I cant fix it as I have no experience with microsoldering but if you can youll have a fantastically working iPhone Or just scrap it and fix other phones with its organs Note Even though this is labelled for parts there is definitely a good chance you can fix it If you do you need to contact me so I can remotely erase it and disable iCloud lock which I will happily do for you as I hate seeing perfectly good electronics go to waste I would do it now but it doesnt work enough to where I can erase it Google Pixel 32GB I bought this phone two years ago and used it for roughly a year until I dropped it a few feet and the screen no longer turns on though the body and screen are totally intact I believe that this is just a matter of a cable being pulled but I dont want to tear it down Once again I fully believe this device is fixable but I have to professional knowledge to promise that so I am labelling this as For Parts Note Same as the iPhone if you do fix this phone I am happy to unlock it for you to use and enjoy But I cannot unlock it now as it does not work iTeknic Wireless Earbuds These are sealed from the factory They cost 40 new and Im knocking off a couple bucks from it I cant review these for obvious reasons but there are youtube reviews of these Geekee Wireless Earbuds These are brand new but not sealed I dont have the original USBC cable so I tossed in a way better one can probably charge at 15W but not confirmed These feel really nice to hold it really feels premium Opening and closing the case as well as removing the earbuds feels really nice as they use strong magnets They are unused so I cant comment on the sound True Wireless Earbuds These are generic no brand but they look and feel really nice They are the airpod style and look premium Again

and have a Pixel 7 Pro Saw the ads for the free watch offer ending on the 16 so I walked into the usually dead Google Store in Chelsea in NYC around 4PM on a Monday to buy the new phone just a few days after it launched There was a line of people waiting to be looked at by Google Store workers So many people were buying the new 8 series phones The Google Store employee I caught right after after he popped out from his break warned me that the phone I want might not be in stock because theyre low in stock I got a Obsidian 8 Pro 512GB but wanted the Blue one He helped me do the trade in and the manager was so busy completing other trade ins and assisting customers that it took him forever to come over to complete mine Anyway I got my phone and a guy who said he is from from Australia was watching me and the Google Store guy chat and when he saw the trade prices I got he did a trade in of his own too just cuz he wanted the watch bonus Im telling you the 8 series will be successful Google did a great job with the free watch and free headphones offer Another lady from Korea also walked into the store when I was leaving and she was so happy when they told her she could get free Earbuds with the 8 lol Just really smart marketing from Google","36":"I love my Google Pixel 5 Its honestly the perfect phone for me Back when the Samsung Note 7 released I picked one up and the phone was amazing The only gripe I had with the phone was that it was a tad bit too big for me Then of course the phone notoriously started catching flames and exploding so Samsung basically sent me a box that looks like it was supposed to contain a bomb and forced me to return my phone to them After that I had a Samsung S7 Galaxy Edge and simply put the downgrade from the Note 7 that I just lost in addition to the phone itself just not being what I really wanted and ended up being probably the worst Phone Ive ever owned worse than my LG env LG env 3 Motorola Rival and iPhone 44S not sure which I had here After my Samsung ended up breaking from drops I needed a new phone at a decent price The Pixel 5 was 700 at the time of purchase with a promotional 50 best buy gift card so I went in on itBest technology purchase Ive ever made This phone is such a beast at a perfect size and the back finger sensor is just so amazing The battery lasts forever even when playing OldSchool Runescape one of the main reasons I bought the phone It also has 5G capabilities and 5G is ridiculously fast for me when I have it My girlfriend still suffers from 4G LTE Her Samsung Note 10 barely fits in my pocket sometimes Its also an awesome phone for sure but Id argue that my Google Pixel 5 has more desirable features than her flagship Samsung Note at a notably cheaper price point The only downside I have with my phone is the lack of an earbud port but my girlfriend got me Google pixel buds for Christmas one year and they work great with the phone anywaysThen I saw the Pixel 6 and was honestly disappointed The phone is too big No more back sensor The camera bezel is kind of ugly to me I dont know why Google decided to randomly change their design At this point Im going to probably be buying the smallest and best smartphone on the market at a justifiable price and I hope Google returns to something similar like the Pixel 5 Its just such a great phone and Im going to be sad if and when my phone inevitably needs to be replaced if I dont still have a similar optionWith that said any recommendations for phones post Pixel 5 Is the Pixel 5a also good too I probably wont be buying a phone for a while but just want to know what other phone alternatives I should keep my eye on if the Pixel 789 etc continue the design trends of the Pixel 6Thanks for reading my love letter to the Pixel 5","37":"The Pixel 8a 128gb is absolutely the best phone I have had in years and got it on launch day May 14 2024 from OptusAustralia and on contract at half pricerrp is 849 over 3 years The cameras

opportunity aroseI was on holiday scrolling through Reddit and I found a post a gentleman upset that hed missed out on the big discounts offered by Google currently when trading in Consider my interest peaked I went on their website to find that if I trade in my Pixel 7 theyd give me 450 and I could get the 9 pro XL for 650 with a set of new pixel buds pro 2What a deal I jumped at it and I am in love a great improvement so far the camera and QOL features Im in love with the new features best take and the add me stuff is fantastic just a lovely lovely phone more than happyI spent a bit of time deliberating between sticking with my Sony WF1000XM5 earbuds and swapping to the new buds I know the sounds quality is slightly better on the Sonys but sticking with the same ecosystem and also having the Find my device and audible noises if you lose them was the real winner for me","43":"My Buds Pro 2 Arrived today theyre excellentFor context Ive never used Airpods or other expensive earbuds only PBP1 ASeries and some cheap Anker ones as well as various over ear headphonesPros Super comfortable I was never able to wear PBP1 for more than 45 minutes or so without ear strain These are much much better Id say they are just as comfortable as the Aseries buds I was never not once able to pass the ear seal check on the old Buds Pro I ordered the foam tips and everything On PBP2 it passed first try They connect to the phone way faster The Case to Playing time is probably about 2 seconds now down from 67 seconds before You can turn on ANC while wearing only 1 earbud now which you couldnt do on PBP1 The transparency mode is incredible They advertise how much better the ANC is it is definitely better but I wasnt blown away but the Transparency mode is the real winner here Limited testing so far but conversation mode actually works now Was janky as hell on PBP1Cons Sound quality seems identical Honestly the bass is a bit worse but that can be compensated for with the EQ I wish there were better color options I guess Im a pink earbuds wearer now ","44":"Hi All looking to sell a few items that I no longer needTimestamps\u00a0httpsimgurcomaeFj6wtjhttpsimgurcomaeFj6wtj1

this trend every year since 2022 after a pixel launch All the YouTubers start making these comparison videos of the flagship pixel with a Samsung flagship of the same year And as always the Samsung flagships wins with a clean slate besides cameras making pixels look like a bad purchase Then 2 months after release around nov or dec some of the major YouTubers do this yearly smartphone awards where they award phones in different categories Somehow Pixel phones since 2022 so basically since pixel 7pro manages to win best flagshipandroid or smartphone of the year android or is at least a really close contender And not to mention about the camera awards that even a budget pixels wins sometimes Im usually in xcom or threads tech space and I see people constantly complaining about everything So Im wondering with all the complains that people have about how these phones are lackluster and doesnt have enough performance and or how Google is doomed how it still manages to be at least at the top even with the underperforming chip than vast majority of the smartphones I mean with the hype that the 9 series is getting I wouldnt be surprised if they would be the favourites","46":"Background of the purchase I had been using an iPhone but since my childs kindergarten activities required a recording device I found it challenging to find a suitable DV It seems that major companies are now focusing on smart phone recording devices After some research I was drawn to the Pixel 9 Pro for its 5x zoom lens video boost feature and Gemini and I also wanted to try the latest Android system So I decided to go with the Pixel 9 ProImpressive features1 The zoom quality up to 15x is quite good and the Video Boost feature is stunning perfectly meeting my needs for recording my childs kindergarten activities2 Gemini is incredibly convenient quick inquiries and responses from the local LLM are very efficient and its voice recognition capability is excellent3 I can use apps to block spam calls and texts Finally 4 The display is detailed and vibrant and various apps run very smoothly5 Six months of free Google One Gemini Advance provides me with an additional LLM service option Sometimes the answers from gemini advance are better than GPT4o6 Adding events and performing other tasks with Gemini Advance is very convenientAreas for Improvement1 First the Bluetooth is very disappointing I enjoy using Bluetooth earbuds while doing chores but if I move more than 5 meters from the phone the sound starts breaking up In my opinion reliable Bluetooth connectivity is a basic requirement for a smartphone and Pixel didnt meet this standard which is really unfortunate2 As a regular user I cant see much difference between 12MP and 50MP photos Plus you cant take continuous shots at 50MP which is frustrating when I need to capture multiple moments quickly3 Photos and videos can only be cast to a TV via Chromecast not Miracast I have a Chromecast 4K device a 4K TV and WiFi 6 but casting 50MP photos or 4K videos still appears blurry4 The Recent Apps gesture swiping up from the bottom fails frequently I like to close unnecessary apps and while this gesture is similar to the iPhones it often seems like the Pixel is actively blocking me from accessing Recent Apps5 Geminis responses are often too wordy and I typically only need brief answers Using prompts to refine responses leads to longer voice interactions which increases the risk of speech recognition errors6 Fingerprint unlock occasionally fails7 I cant remove the Google search UI at the bottom and the screenshot and search buttons in Recent Apps are also permanent As a regular user I dont need frequent search access8 The power and volume buttons are on the same side which makes it easy to press the wrong one9 The news recommendations on the leftmost screen of the home page cant be customized for another feature such as frequently used app predictions I dont like these news recommendations and can only turn them off rather than replace them with something more useful10 Theres no feature showing recommended apps based on my current context or historical usage dataReiterating I am just an ordinary user who doesnt enjoy gaming and only looks at my phone screen for about 30 minutes a day while using Bluetooth headphones to listen to audio for around 2 hours The issues Ive encountered might be due to individual device quality or possibly my lack of understanding of the proper usage methods","47":"Hey everyone Im coming from an iPhone 12 and I gotta say Im super impressed with the phone so far The camera is outstanding especially the night shots The battery life is insane I was getting roughly 45 hours of on screen time and now I get roughly 89 hours For example I take my phone off the charger at 530 in the morning and by the time I put it on the charger at night Im left with 20 with streaming Spotify all day I work in a warehouse with earbuds in all day and watching YouTube on the way to work and back home and at lunch Overall I dont think Ill be going back to apple unless they come out with something that really breaks the mold but the higher refresh rate and different system os have been keeping me entertained","48":"I might get downvoted for this but I just wanted to share my opinion I know a lot of peoplereviews say that its better to just get the regular pixel 7 rather than the 7a but here is my point of viewperspective1 The original MSRP without factoring in any deals The price difference between the 7a and the regular 7 may seem small at only 100 but its still a significant amount By opting for the 7a you can use the extra 100 to purchase accessories like a case screen protector wireless charger or charger brick since its not included or even splurging on some earbuds you can get more value for your money2 You also get longer updates too with the 7a Pixel 7 is already seven months old and the software updates will only last until October 2025 already 24 years left with security updates until October 2027 which is a long time but the 7a will probably have longer updates since it was released later3 The 7a is much more durable than the 7 Based on a durability test video with the 7ahttpsyoutubezZJ0fwbbP8 compared to the 7 pro durability testhttpsyoutubernPPygtQHw Im assuming that the 7 has the same design build quality as the 7 proOverall the Pixel 7a is a better value than the regular Pixel 7 in my opinion It is cheaper has longer software updates and is more durable If you are looking for a great phone at a good price the Pixel 7a is the better option in my opinionEdit for reference I have the Pixel 4A 4G and these seems like a lot of upgrades for me for 100 less and I just got 7a at best buy for 450 brand new so 50 off MSRP and the same price when the pixel 6a when it was also brand new","49":"Hello there  I got my Redmi Buds 6 Pro yesterday and Im loving them thus far I came from the Redmi Buds 4 Pro which I unfortunately lost I have one issue with the 6 Pros though  These earbuds are advertised to have LDAC and I have seen posts where people talk about LDAC in these and screenshots where LDAC is shown in settings and whatnot However while I had access to LDAC on my 4 Pros and my Pixel 7 I cannot find it anywhere on my new earbuds either in the Xiaomi App or the earbuds settings page on my connected devices list I have them updated to their latest version  Has anybody had an issue like that before Is it maybe on but for some reason it does not show anywhere Can you suggest any way I can verify what is going on  Cheers","50":"I got a pixel 7 around two years ago At first I really enjoyed the phone hopping off from an iphone 11 At first It didnt feel that big of a upgrade but the screen and camera were betterBut then daily driving this phone I constantly have problems with connecting to internet and bluetooth Ive had 3 different earbuds with my pixel Sony JBL and now Galaxy budsEvery day I experience bugs and lags in my audio with suddenly disconnecting devices from my bt Just listening to a song while on a bike to campus none of that I will suddenly disconnect you Sitting at my desk I will suddenly desync your buds so your audio will be horrible I have tried all 3 earbuds with my Samsung Galaxy tab and my laptop and they worked fine amazing actuallyHave kept my pixel up to date and everything it is not a problem on my case But the Bluetooth problems are just getting worse and worse never had such bad connection even with my Huawei p20 lite and some 20 euro bluetooth earphones Very sad to have this as listening to music is crucial and connecting to wifi As websites dont load on my picel my tablet next to it works fine streaming in high resolution I work in telecom and am certain that it is a problem with my deviceOveral it was passable but not as amazing as I have heard from others so this will for certain be my last pixel phone","51":"I have a very specific problem with my new buds 2 pro When I connect the buds to my P7 initially everything works fine but after a call on the buds or the buds being idle for a long time all the other audio redirects to the phone speakers rather than the earphones itself The problem here is I can still control the music volume change tracks and everything with my buds and the phones bluetooth settings shows that its still connected but the audio cannot be routed through the buds During this time the galaxy wearable app also has a problem loading the status of my buds and only a disconnectreconnection solves the issue I noticed that turning off LE audio in bluetooth settings for the buds solved this issue but Im trying to understand why this might be the case Does turning off LE audio mean I can never play highres audio on my new buds PS I had the original buds pro prior to this which never had this problem","52":"Guys was planning to get these Samsung AKG type c earphones for my laptop and phone But not sure if the mic is good enough to attend regular meetings and will the windows laptop support itPlease review if anyone is using and also i hope it supports Pixel 7Thanks","53":"Having gotten bored of my previous phone a Samsung Galaxy F62 I began my quest to daydream about my future phone I fixated my eyes on a rather old device iPhone 14Pro Willing to spend a major chunk of my income on a new phone it would be an understatement to say that my family did not share my excitement But my older brother did support me and we went to look for a new phone I went to a local phone shop not so local a major brand and asked if they had a Pixel phone The shopper started giving me lessons on Android in a rather aggressive manner and he seemed to take offense at my crime of asking for a Pixel phone He wanted me to be punished for this crime with a Vivo phone It was sleek and sexy but I did not want a Vivo or any other Chinese phone I had made up my mind I would buy one of the three  Google Samsung or iPhone Funny how we dont use Apple for Apple phones Then I began my hunt to test a few phones fell in love with the new iPhone 15 base variant loved the back glasss texture better than the pro I quickly realized that it was unwise to spend this big amount of money on a phone So I tried the phone I had thought of buying a Samsung Galaxy S23 I love that phone I think it is made for me but it is much overpriced Meanwhile during the phone hunt I had my eyes on the Green Pixel After thinking a lot managing the finances I took the plunge and ordered a new phone for me  A green Pixel 7 One month later I still havent fallen in love with the phone Its a great phone dont get me wrong Its just that I became comfortable with my previous Samsung way faster Google should allow as much if not less customization as Samsung I dont like to use a case or a screen guard on my phones but knowing it is an expensive phone I am forced to use a case and guard I did not buy into the Pixel camera hype and please believe me I did not buy the Pixel for its camera The camera is mostly nice but it makes you feel and realize that it is not the hardware thats working it is the software and that has taken away some of the satisfaction I was hoping to get from my Pixel I havent faced any problems with the phone some bugs here and there But the phone does not offer anything extra for me it is good enough The only things I hate on my phone are its fingerprint sensor and a lack of a headphone jack I cannot stress this enough I miss my fricking wired earphones and I refuse to buy Bluetooth ear pods I like my existing earphones but theyre lying lifelessly in my cupboard The fingerprint sensor is very slow and very inaccurate I hate it and wish that future phones have Apples Face ID or a sidemounted fingerprint sensor or a fucking fast sensor I was not expecting Pixels to have good video recording capability but it has and I am more than satisfied with the videos coming out straight from the native app It is very good Pixel images are hit or miss for me I love the colors but quality takes a hit sometimes it is not as consistent as an iPhone To sum up if my Pixel had a headphone jack I think I would have been the most the happiest soul in the world An adapter will not give the same level of satisfaction One thing I love about the Pixel is its design I love flaunting it Overall it is a good phone but this phone is not for everyone A better option for folks would be a cheaper phone or a little more expensive one OnePlus 11 I would even recommend the S22 but it has a rubbish battery CheersI live in India S22 was cheaper than the Pixel 7 one plus 11 was around 7k Rupees expensive than the P7 at the time of purchase","54":"Im upgrading from a Motorola MOTO G 3rd gen bought at the end of 2015 I dont play games Just calls messaging social media now and then some videos playing music with earphones or sending it to chromecastbluetooth speakers occasional photos Maps I want something that lasts some years maybe another 7 years why notComing back from hypersleep after 7 years Im kind of confused with new brands and models Im in for a new device in the 200300  range Im in Europe It seems that Motorola and Nokia are not the way to go anymore in this range so first I was leaning towards Xiaomi Oppo Oneplus or SamsungI dont know if I will be happy with some of the more oversaturated UIs some of these brands use since I kind of prefer the simple and clean UI in my old Moto so I was looking for something with not too many preinstalled fancy apps or ads Hence my interest in the Pixel 6a which I can buy now for 350  I like the design and the stock android It seems to be nice and functional but Im a bit worried about battery as well as other specs RAM screen becoming obsolete too soon I dont need my phone to be a Google Pixel so Im open to any other brand if I can get a better value device for the same or less money So I wouldnt mind choosing another model if there is something with more value overall According to some people you get more value better specs with Chinese models these days Keeping in mind that Im willing to spend 200300  or even 350 if I get a Pixel 6a and that I hope to get a lasting phone what do you think","55":"Coming from an S22 Ultra Snapdragon Ive had the Z Flip 5 for a few days and here are my thoughts in no particular order Screen The main pro is that the flipping aspect is awesome Novel but with a purpose and the footprint in my pocket is noticeably better obviously The main con for me is that the screen is borderline unusable if you have polarized glasses severe rainbow effect and that is not the case with the S22 Ultra The plastic feeling vs tempered glass is also a negative but it seems better than I had expected Fingerprint sensors They both have pretty good sensors but I do find that the Z Flip 5s misses more when my hands are sweaty if Im out on a bike ride for example Speakers I think both speakers are average to above average and I do think the Z Flip 5s are pretty decent Headphone sound quality Seems very good on both devices Shure earphones and it can power HD600s Charging speeds The S22U is much better in this regard even topping up from 80 to 100 it seems to pull more watts than the ZF5 The ZF5 will top out at like 12W on a 90W PD charger where my S22U will charge at a much higher rate Cameras Obviously the S22U has way more versatility with the 3x and 10x and the lack of telephoto on the ZF5 might be the thing I miss the most For now Ill deal with it and Im taking fewer pictures unless I carry a second phone or my real camera Performance Seems to be about the same between either phone I did get a the phone is warm toast notification when I was setting it up but I had it out and about today in 85F weather and there were no issues The ZF5 also force restarted itself when I tried using Google Assistant on the cover screen then opened it up and it rebooted Ill keep an eye on that Battery life S22U does have an edge but thats to be expected even being 18 months old at this point I think the ZF5s battery life is acceptable and I typically am around chargers much of the day My typical use has gotten me about 1518 hours with 354 hours SOT so I can live with thatOverall this little phone is pretty awesome The cover screen with the Good Lock apps module makes this thing pretty usable without even opening it up I will admit that laying out 7mo for Samsungs care program is worth it for my peace of mind I dont really have a ton of confidence in this phone lasting more than a year or so due to the moving parts but as with a lot of people I will be planning on trading it in next summer if the trade in deals are still amazing","56":"I have a Pixel 7 and had some pixel buds aseries earphones They were good enough for me personally but now after 8 months the left bud is noticeably quieter than the right I want to upgrade to a better pair and the galaxy buds also caught my eye I really liked the pixel buds The fit was really good the sound was good and they were overall just a really nice pair of earbuds But I hear the galaxy buds are meant to be good also Each have pros and cons So I ask you which would you go for and why Would I lose any compatibility switching from my phones brand Google to Samsung","57":"Samsung CalendarIf youve been saving your calendar events to a Samsung account instead of Gmail there is no easy way to transfer the data to Google Calendar at least not that I know of I installed an app called Calendar Import  Export ics on the Galaxy and proceeded to backup Samsung Calendars 500 entries I placed the backup file on Google Drive and opened it on Pixel The Google Calendar on Pixel was only able to import 200 entries Its as if there is a hardcoded limit set to 200 tried multiple timesIn the end I had to do everything manually open a calendar event on Galaxy tap edit change the sync account to Gmail Do it for every calendar entry tap sync on Galaxy tap sync on PixelBackup your appsMake sure to manually backup the data in your important apps especially messenger apps on the Galaxy because not everything will be automatically transferred during the Pixel setup Some apps do automatically backup their data but only once a week so a manual backup immediately before a transfer is necessaryDisplay Refresh90Hz refresh rate is good enough Coming from 120Hz I didnt feel a noticeable difference Im sure if you place them sidebyside itll be visible but 90 is far better than 60Screen QualityPixel has a better screen Its sharper Im nearsighted so whenever I dont wear glasses in bed the display is really close to my face This is why every ppi counts I havent noticed a worse picture quality Again if we place them sidebyside we might notice something but its a great screenGalaxy has a higher maximum brightness Probably only useful outdoors under the sunBrightness controlGalaxy has a better screen brightness management Pixels automatic brightness always makes it too dim literally seconds after I manually swipe the bar higher No matter how many times I manually move the slider it doesnt seem to learn Ill give it a week and switch the brightness to manual control Gesture controlGalaxy wins I had to use an ADB command on a laptop to disable Pixels gesture navigation and replace it with the FNG app because for some reason Google thinks there are no apps with hamburger menus so they made their back gesture in a way that it occupies the entire left edge from top to bottom leaving no room at the top for the user to swipe right to open a drawer in an app You literally cant open app drawers The workaround is to tap and hold the edge until a drawer popsout and only then swipe But why make the experience worse for the user if a better option is available Google Samsung with its inhouse custom apps forgot what they are called handles it far better App launcherPixel launcher is a joke It lacks basic customization features too many to list and occupies a huge chunk of the main homepage with an at a glance useless crapware and an impossibletomove search bar I installed Microsoft Launcher and customized it to the core Hey at least we have an option to install launchers NotificationsFirst of all Samsungs email app is better than the Gmail app When an email arrives Samsung lets you mark it read right in the notification popup Gmail only lets you archivedelete Its a little annoyance that wastes time unnecessarilySecond Gmail wont sync and display every email unless I manually sync the inbox I removed all the background restrictions on Gmail and hopefully itll work So far it does seem to have fixed the problem Why on Earth does Gmail come with restricted background activities by defaultNotification panel looks better on Galaxy The notification entries on Pixel feel bulky and a waste of space Pull down quick settingsPixel only shows 4 entries vs the 6 on Galaxy This is a big difference The whole purpose of this thing is to place the most commonly used activities a single tap away Not only does Pixel waste space by using unnecessarily huge buttons but it requires you to make another swipe to see a total of 8 entries Then another right swipe to see the rest Its just poorly designedBluetooth earphonesIm using Galaxy Buds No connection or quality issues on Pixel There is a dead spot in my house so I wanted to compare how the two phones handle it when I leave the phone away and enter the dead spot With Galaxy the sound begins to break up a word will be dropped here and there and after half a minute of struggling it may or may not disconnect from the phone On Pixel it actually continues to play without dropped words but then suddenly disconnects much sooner than on Galaxy Not sure if this is phonerelated or something else Photo backupsI used OneDrive on Galaxy It seems better than Google Photos because it actually preserves the timestamps of your photos and provides a dedicated folder with photos Last time I used Google Takeout to download the photo database last year it fucked up every single photo I had to spend several weekends and use software to edit the photos to insert the timestamps on the file names For example IMG20221205jpg means its taken on December 5 2022 When you place it in a folder Windows Explorer should properly sort it under December 5 But the photos exported from Google Photos no longer had this timestamps so they were all showing the date when they were exported from Google servers OneDrive does properly save timestamps and it actually makes the photos accessible as a folder in the OneDrive app on your desktop You can take a photo on the phone and open the OneDrive folder on the desktop and your photo will be there In comparison there is no Google Photo folder in Google Drive you have to use their website to access the photos Downloading multiple photos from Google Photos requires you to go through annoying menu entries download one big zip file then unzip it Now compare this to a simple draganddrop with OneDrive We have a winnerLumia vibesLet me tell you an old story The best feeling phone Ive ever held in my hand was the Microsoft Lumia 640 It was a squareish phone that felt right at a time when every other manufacturer was busy ruining their phones with curvy edges and shit that nobody asked for Fk that shit Pixel 7 feels like Lumia 640 It feels squareish and kind of on the heavy side for its display size but it feels balanced and premium heavy not let me put it down because my wrist is hurting heavyPerformancePixel gets noticeably hotter The games I play are not too resources intensive so I personally dont care about having the best CPUEcosystemGoogle wins here I even decided to switch from Galaxy Watch 4 to Fitbit Inspire 3 They are two entirely different products Galaxy Watch is a watch with full functionality while Fitbit is a fitness tracker with more limited functions And yet Fitbit feels better and more useful after two days of using it Its better simply because its lighter smaller and lasts longer Ill take those over fancy watch keyboards and app stores that I know Im never going to use  I spent the entire day with it on my wrist and totally forgot about it Galaxy Watch on the other hand is always there and waiting to be adjusted twisted tightened or loosened No maintenance necessary with Fitbit Oh and its battery lasts much longerScreen protectorI wasnt able to find a tempered glass screen protector for Galaxy S22 that works with the fingerprint reader Im aware there is a setting to increase sensitivity but it still missed the taps 50 of the time On Pixel 7 on the other hand the very first tampered glass that I came across to a cheap crap form eBay has worked wonderfully Is it because they use different finger sensing technologiesTradeinIm paying practically nothing by trading the S22 for Pixel 7 and Fitbit Hopefully Google will honor the trade in terms","58":"Ive been looking to upgrade from a OnePlus 7 pro for a while now but each phone has their flaws so Im currently considering the s23 ultra except Ive had motherboard issues with them last time I have noted down all the problems listed about the pixel 7 pro are they fixed with the

earphones headphones through Bluetooth Concerns on weaker network connectivity and LTE really bad WIFI Samsung modems instead of Qualcomm modemIm told the front camera has not been given any priority

load an app sound assistant and it lets the phone play multiple audio sources at once like games music audio book and Streaming social media can all output into earphones Without that app behavior of the phones tends to be one audio source plays at a timeHows it work on pixels That multisource audio is a big deal to me Its the difference between being gimpy phonelike and computerlike as far as audio outputThanks","60":"So before the pitchforks come out here me outx200BThis is for whoevers thinking about trying the Pixel 77 Pro I hope people can be open minded and not be in a walled garden for any one company Its sometimes best to know whats out there to make an informed decision That being saidx200BThis review obviously isnt comprehensive nor is it complete Its simply my thoughts on the Pixel 7 Pro having used it for a week and perhaps thatd be more apt than review Some caveats to add Its a brand new phone Everything in theory is working at its absolute best Im comparing it against the S22u and I am well aware these phones are in two different categories in terms of pricing and how they are viewed in terms of their respective hierarchiesx200BAlso to note Ive owned many of the modern flagships in the past few years ranging from the 6 Pro S21U 13 Pro Max Note 20 Ultra 12 Pro Max Pixel 5 etc etcx200BMy initial thoughts I cant appreciate enough how light it feels in the hand It has a nice uniformity to it and its not as awkward to hold as the S22U nor as girthy as the Pro Max series This doubles when you consider its offering relatively the same height and basically design metrics as those two You also wouldnt be able to tell the difference between the 6 Pro and 7 Pro if you flipped them on their fronts Design is great When I first saw the renders I have to be honest and say I wasnt too much of a fan of either the 7 or how the 6 looked The 45 design was OK I do miss the twotoned days of the older Pixels though My favorite However its been growing on me Especially after seeing it in person Ya know for the 5 seconds before I put a case and lens protector on it Ill make a quick note and suggest that you do look into getting a case since they say the back camera bar is far more prone to scratches than its predecessor Fantastic display Id certainly say its up there with the S22U  absolutely gorgeous and crisp on QHD It definitely gets a lot brighter than its predecessors which is saying a lot because a problem I personally had with the Pixel line up was that it didnt offer nearly good enough brightness as the competitors It wasnt horrible but it wasnt great either I feel the 7 puts it in line with where modern smartphones should be and then some Almost forgot to mention this but the haptic feedback isnt bad at all iPhones rendition is superior but I cant complain hereQuality is clear and nice I should note that Ive seen a complaint on forums stating how users are experiencing yellowishtint and washed out colors on their 77 Pros I havent experienced this or maybe my eyes arent that great at discerning it YMMV Speakers arent bad Its loud and if Im not mistaken perhaps louder than the S22U but certainly not as full sounding I dont have an issue with it and I typically use my earphones anyways But good speaker and sound quality nonetheless I havent tuned it nor care to But Im sure thats an option if you should choose Battery isnt bad When I bought the 6 Pro I had bought it used and the battery drain was noticeable I dont know how this will fair in the next month or so but for now it gets me through a day comfortably with moderate usage Youtube social media Google maps no gaming I got about 5 hrs of screen on time from 100to20 with the above usage If my math is correct that would make it 6 if I ran it to zero QHD 60 brightness  which is in line with what I was getting on my used S22U I will admit I havent used the camera extensively although Im very much familiar with both the Pixel and Samsungs methods of photography This doesnt matter all that much because the 7 Pro largely borrows from the 6 Pro in a lot of ways with maybe a few iterative updatesupgrades This extends to the selife camera which looks virtually no different then how it did on the 6 Pro The viewfinder looks really grainy in low light and I know most phones do but its REALLY noticeable on the 67 Pro and decent during the daytime The pictures are meh at best The sharpness and quality that Pixels were known for in their older models is not here And in all honestly its almost as if it has regressed  in my OPINION I still say S22U is EASILY the standout phone when it comes to selfies holding that title since the S21U of both the Pixel AND Pro Max series The selfies look low quality At least if youre comparing it to other modern flagships Not as sharpx200B Front cameras are great as always Again I havent had a chance to really explore with portrait shots and other environment snaps but for the pictures I have taken theyve come out pretty good For the record Im not one of those reviewers like the Tech channels that are taking pictures and then blowing them up to see every nuanced hair follicle to discern whether or not one takes better quality pictures over the other I very much take most pictures at face value And youd be hard pressed to find differences in most flagship phones unless were talking each respective companies computational takes on different exposures and environments In which case if you know your phones its really no different here But I will admit after having taking many many pictures with different phones over the few years Id say the older Pixels think 23 had the lead in this category say for the botched portrait shots some photos had with the single lens shooter then iPhone was a close second and easily the most consistent Now S22U takes this category I feel its the most well rounded in terms of stills and its camera suite However as the reviewers put it the Pixel does capture more details in most instances FWIW 95 of viewing my photos on my phone so its not a big deal to mex200B Video Almost forgot to mention this The video on this thing is great Id say the camera quality is sharper than the S22Us video The degree of view from the primary camera seems slightly larger too in comparison although I may be imagining this Im gonna have to look at the specs to verify Aside from that its great Havent done much shooting with video yet but if the 6 Pro is anything to go by its in the conversation with phones outputting the best video quality x200B Performance is great Ive yet to come across a stutter or lag but time will tell Apps are snappy upon opening and closing and the navigating the UI is buttery smooth This has carried on from the Pixel 6 Pro In my experience its more smoother than the S22U but do note its a matter of opinion and experience When I had the 6 Pro beside my S22U the S22U lag was noticeable However it became a nonissue during my usage and Id say the S22 is pretty damn snappy in its own right I know many people want to know about the fingerprint reader and I gotta say its been damn impressive Aside from maybe two times where it didnt work and of the two times I had to tap to wake up and then push again I have no complaints Its super fast and on par with the S22U at the time of writing this The face unlock however is noticeably not as quick as the S22U or the iPhone S22U being the fastest and the iPhone being the best and most consistentx200B Features If youre familiar with the features of the 6 Pro then the features here should come as no surprise Theyre awesome Magic eraser works fantastically but I will say Samsungs version is also fantastic Call screening is great for those that get stupid robo calls or scammer calls often Hold For Me is a delight to have A few calls I had during this week were made that much easier due to this featurex200BIf I had to nitpick about anything its that Samsungs keyboards learning algorithms worked better for me than GBoard  specifically with adding to the dictionary or learning my usage patterns Samsungs keyboard would pick it up and suggest words Id often use within a few sessions where as with Google Ive had it add and then forget words I use often or outright not suggest it to me at all And its learning algorithm to suggest words takes longer  in my experience  than Samsungs HOWEVER again  in my experience  GBoard is far more accurate at determining which keys I hit than Samsungs keyboardx200BTakeaways for comparison sake My OPNIONx200B S22U has the better design minimalist look less intrusive camera set up less scratch prone Pixel more ergonomically friendlier in the hand and lighter S22U destroys the selfie camera on the 7 Pro S22U takes better portraits is better for zoom and offersmore flexibility with its camera options the 7 Pro is more crispersharper  and in most cases  truer to life S22U does a better job at multitasking Pixels UI feels more snappier S22Us speakers more fuller sounding Pixels more louder  Both phones have fantastic displays but the S22U gets brighter both get plenty bright though Face unlock is faster on the S22U Fingerprint unlock is about the same in terms of accuracy Battery life about the same Brand new Pixel 7 Pro vs used S22U Features offered and how you like them is entirely dependent on your use case Keyboard more accurate on Gboard but better learning algorithmssuggestions on Samsung at time of writingx200BIf you have any questions let me know Ill try to answer them as best I can","61":"So its one of those silly things that bother me a lot for no good reason but I do want to know if anyone knows a solution to it Currently Samsung Watch 4 Previous phone Samsung Note S10  Current phone Google Pixel 7 ProI used to have a Samsung Note phone but I switched to google Pixel recently Connecting the watch and earphones no problem but with the new phone my AR Emoji person restarted and I cant seem to get her back I cant download AR Emoji on Pixel sadly but I wondered if there is a work around I even tried to see if it has to do something with Samsung Cloud but sadly no results or I am doing it wrong  Thank you for all and any help If sadly no work around back to boring Galaxy Watch faces ","62":"I love tech I love looking at the clever and useful and beautiful and innovative new ways clever people have made me want to throw my disposable income at them Back in 2008 after a period of being skeptical of the lack of haptic feedback in a touch screen I was convinced enough from trying an iPhone out that I imported jailbroke and queued my way up to getting them for myself Then the competition choice and fullfeaturedness of Android lured me away Circa 2014 just 7 years since the iPhone changed the world I had in my pocket a tiny waterproof multimedia computing device with an incredibly capable camera attached Email youtube internet ebooks music podcasts portable storage gaming photo and video editing you name it Full featured hardware I could plug external microSD storage into it headphone jack let me plug my earphones into it and used the earphone wire as an antenna for FM radio For the next couple of years wed only get improvements USB OTG was great It was a heady feeling I looked forward to new releases  This was the future that was promisedAll that is by way of background so that you know where Im coming from when I say I have had it up to here with the sorry and pathetic state of the modern mobile phone marketWhen an upgrade is not an upgrade What pushed me over the edge was my upgrade from the Xperia XZ1 Compact to the Pixel 3 which I bought because Google put took US300 off its retail price I use the word upgrade loosely The Pixels battery life is significantly worse The fingerprint sensor is worse The size and position of the phone and the controls which in the XZ1C allowed for onehanded operation from the moment I touched it to the moment I put it down is worse on the Pixel There is no headphone jack my IEMs dont work unless I use the dongle and then I have to carry around this extra freaking dongle around No more hardware notification LED that I can customise to different colours for different notifications No microSD slot which I used rather extensively on the XZ1C About the only practically useful improvement to me was the camera and I suppose actually having Android 10 and a couple more years of software updates The rest  wireless charging better speakers bigger screen  theyre nice to have but dont really make a huge impact on my needs In short in all practical respects the Pixel 3 is actually a major downgrade from the XZ1C Whats the alternative If there were something on the market for me to buy Id have considered it But it is 2019 and if you want a compact long lasting yet fully featured phone with a headphone jack micro SD card slot waterproofing easy to use onehand accessible side fingerprint sensor that is reasonably priced your best bet is the XZ1C a phone released in 2017 Your second best bet is the walletbursting S10e at US749 The Pixel 3 was a compromise purchase which only made it into consideration because of its discounted price I dont know of any other alternatives Worst of all all signs point to regression See if I thought there was something better coming soon or if signs pointed to progress I would accept the Pixel 3 as a temporary dip until something better comes along Instead the trends are bad  Headphone jack baleeted I have a nice pair of wired IEMs that I use Nope the manufacturer and trends say youve gotta use this doodad the marketing folks call a true wireless BT earphone which is the best thing ever Its not I hear of jabras and sony 1000XM3s where one bud doesnt connect right audio cuts out distorts is too soft  too loud what have you Lets be fair and lets be real youre not listening to audiophile grade music on the subway or grunting your way through a workout but it would be nice to be able to use some of the nice stuff I already have lying around instead of being forced to buy overpriced new shit Side mounted fingerprint sensor nobody seems to do this anymore Theyre all back mounted on massive slabs Its awkward to use You USAians dont know what youre missing but the Sony compact phones side sensors were awesome to use Meanwhile the Pixel 4 doesnt even have a fingerprint sensor  Micro SD cards gone Why would you ever want to plug external storage in I imagine manufacturers asking The mind boggles  I have transferred car accident footage reviewed and edited camera footage stored extra data all with the micro SD But theres an app for that I imagine the manufacturers blubbering Right so you want me to use your bloated unstable privacy invading ad serving mess over a simple micro SD card  Dual sims while not gone they seem to not be so popular anymore Which is a crying shame dual sims are a godsend for anyone who travels for business Hell remember when the second sim slot doubled up as a micro SD slot  Radio the chips can do it at least the Snapdragon 835s and 845s could and I know my Z1 Compact had a radio but it seems that manufacturers dont wire it into their phones anymore Now I gotta use data to stream radio through a 4G LTE connection that doesnt reach weird corners of my home and cuts out when I go into a tunnel NOICE Progress is GREAT  Prices the iPhone 11 pro is US999 The Samsung Note 10 US945 I only bought the Pixel 3 because it was on discount pending the Pixel 4s release Who spends US1000 on a device with a nonuserserviceable battery that will have to be replaced in 2 years Thats laptop money  Is there a market for people like meAm I asking the world here I could easily give up a few features for another but compactness decent battery life waterproofing a headphone jack and affordability are all pretty high up on the wishlist And the worst part is these features used to exist in commercially available phones Manufacturers arent that stupid They will chase trends they think will sell carve out niches they think they can corner and have entire teams dedicated to market research and feature development to get them there But something is wrong here because my impression is that what the mainstream wants is a thin fragile giant 65 screen phone with a notch on the front hairthin bezels which they will need to buy a pair of airpod lookalikes for that will be covered in a thick protective case and a pop socket which will maybe last until lunchtime which they will throw away next year Am I SOL Is there a market for me I see people complain about these things all the time but I guess were not putting our money where our mouth is because manufacturers arent serving us  Please I have some money and I wish to exchange it for awesome and exciting goods and services  Just as a footnote it was eyerollingly depressing to watch Ivy Ross on Googles stream yesterday going on and on about sustainability being one of the most fundamental challenges of our generation only to have her talk about the recycled plastic used in the construction of the fabric in their Nest speaker Lady we throw away our phones every 2 years because there is no alternative to repair or upgrade when your phones are literally glued into place And this happens at a global scale One of your lines was what if you didnt need to upgrade a bulky new game console every few yearshttpsyoutubeXKmsYB54zBkt1138 and your segueway was into promoting Stadia I understand thats your job and I dont begrudge you toeing the company line but goddamn that is some high level mental gymnastics going on","63":"I only did this because my 5as screen broke and wouldnt turn on I didnt want to really go through the faff of replacing the screen So here are some things I noted after I bought it I really like the design of this phone It feels much more distinct with that camera bar design And not sure if anyone has mentioned it but the lack of rounded corners is a huge win in my opinion I dont have much of a problem with rounded corners but a boxier look is what I prefermakes it feel like a note phone to me just without the stylus Also the centred holepunch is better than a corner one as it makes my screenshots look better lol I bought it in white so thats also a plus considering the boring black I had before Display is obviously an upgrade at least in the refresh rate Though I dont get why the boosted colour profile isnt available I dont hate adaptive but its far too saturated for someone who takes a decent amount of photos and does digital art and wants some colour accuracy Natural is just too undersaturated for me Battery life is a bit of a downgrade in comparison to what Im coming from My pixel 5a was a champ at battery life On a full charge it could last me 68 hours at least on WiFi The pixel 7 gets me 56 hours Which isnt really a deal breaker but its not super impressive Then again at least I get in return a much brighter and high refresh rate display Camera is awesome but that is kind of expected considering its a Pixel And its not much of an upgrade quality wise Though I do like the big sensor for the extra light gathering Video is definitely an improvement and it makes me feel more confident in recording them Im yet to test the new features like cinematic mode and Motion mode though As for Tensor G2 I dont care much about the performance or benchmarks as much as the features it enables Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur are really useful to me And the speech to text is crazy fast I try to use it as much as possible over typingAre there any drawbacks coming from the 5a Yes I really miss the fingerprint reader on the back It was in a good position it was fast and reliable that doubled as my notification shade pull down In display fingerprint readers just arent doing it for me Its not even the speed But the reliability isnt too good compared to what I came from Often it takes a few tries to unlock it even with registering twice And you cant use it if you dont wake up your phone unless you use AOD which I dont I wish they used an Ultrasonic one like Samsung why is that type of sensor only being used by them goddamnit AI based face unlock is good enough though And I also miss the headphone jack Now its not a huge deal breaker for me like some people But it was just nice to have one for convenience sake when I do want to use my wired earphones I still mostly use wireless earphones though so whatever Plus I have a decent USBC dongleBut otherwise yeah I really love this phone","64":"Google Pixel Buds Pro vs Apple AirPods Pro  Which One To Buy Google recently released its newest earphones the 200 Pixel Buds Pro which is meant to compete with Apples

Apple Airpods ProCase DesignWhen you put the AirPods Pro  Pixel Buds Pro cases next its easy to tell which Apple has always been white and shiny Since its debut Google has used an offwhite matte finish Both cases allow wireless charging and use USB for cable charging Neither has a large battery in terms of capacity any variation in charging time is minorThe significant distinction here is on paper Google claims that with ANC turned off youll get 11 hours of listening time and seven hours with it set on Apples estimates differ slightlyIt claims 45 hours on a single charge up to 5 if ANC and transparency are turned offWhen you put the Pixel Buds Pro back in the charging case youll receive 31 hours of listening time with ANC turned off and 20 hours with ANC switched on If you recharge the AirPods Pro using the case Apple claims more than 24 hours of listening timeThe Pixel Buds Pro and the AirPods Pro claim an hour of music playback with only 5 minutes in the case And after scrambling to power everything up on my 20minute journey to the gym Ive discovered thats plenty for a 90minute workoutPixel Buds pro vs Airpods Pro  Buds DesignThis is subjective but we believe the Pixel Buds Pro is more appealing and durable Google sells its buds in four different shades Lemongrass coral and charcoal Most userslike the Pixel Bud Pros lowprofile design and robust build quality over the AirPods Pros single color selection Theyre IPX4rated for sweat and water resistance and come with an IPX2rated charging caseThe comfort is excellent but the fit is loose AlsoGoogles Eartip Seal Test is often wrong The lack of builtin wings on the Pixel Buds 2 is a Pixel Buds Pro design flawApple made significant improvements to the design of the AirPods Pro including thinner stems inserted ear tips and IPX4 sweat and water resistant certification According to the Ear Tip Fit Test Apples tips establish a tight seal These buds also stay comfortably on the concha for lengthy periods Unfortunately the build quality is inferior to that of other wireless earbuds resulting in occasional cracks and scratches The same may be stated with the portable charging casePixel Buds pro vs Airpods ProFit  ComfortThis has been the most noticeable change between the AirPods Pro and Pixel Buds Pro for many consumers They have various patterns and feel highly different in the ears The AirPods Pro feels slightly lower in the ear canal with the default tips with a tighter seal They just feel more at ease in there Thats not to say they cant wiggle free Whatever face does in the middle of a set at the gym changes the pressure  loosens things up However when you do a challenging elliptical sweaty event you must repeatedly push a bud back inAside from that the AirPods Pro is reasonably straightforward to slip into each ear and stay securely in place as are Googles Pixel Buds Pro In reality both pairs of earbudsremainsecurely inthe ears and all attempts to shake them off by walking running or headbanging will failThe main distinction between the two is how Google and Apple have designed their earphones to fit The AirPods Pro is largely in your ear with each bud having a protruding stem On the other hand Pixel Buds Pro is put straight into your ear and kept in place by the ear tips and the curve of your earSound QualityThe Pixel Buds Pro has improved over its predecessors Howeverthe Apple AirPods Pro features a larger soundstage and easyaccess spatial audioHowever the sound quality on the Pixel Buds Pro is substantially better Google integrated their allnew bespoke 6core audio engine with an 11mm driver for dynamic results The frequency range is excellent and Googles sound profile handles powerful bass performance better than expected The Volume EQ boosts the bass and treble frequencies when listening at low levels A fiveband EQ and spatial audio will be available later this yearThe AirPods Pro on the other hand exceeds sonic standards with a warm broad soundstage that allows you can hear instruments and singers more clearly The bass is amplified to give music tracks additional punch Users may customize the sound on their iPhone by choosing from over 20 presetsFurthermore these buds provide spatial audio straight out of the box For those unfamiliar with the technology it generates a realistic 3D sound that can be heard on certain Apple Music songs and Dolby Atmosenabled films Users may also share audio with a second set of H1equipped AppleBeats headphones or earbudsGestures  ControlsEach Pixel Buds Pro bud has a rounded outer surface that provides more than just color to the device It also works to generate a surprising number of intuitive touch movementsWith a few touches or a tapandhold you can easily playpause skip go back enable noise cancellation and answer phone calls You can change the volume simply by swiping your finger forward or backward over the surface Because the touch area is rather big getting these movements incorrect is also challengingThe AirPods Pro on the other hand can accomplish most of the same easy tasks owing to a pressuresensitive button on the stem That is everything but volume control Apple advises utilizing Siri or changing your phones volume settings on an iPhone The AirPods Pro demands a more accurate twofinger pinch than the Pixel Buds series singlefinger tap Moreover depending on the angle at which the AirPods Pro is inserted into your ear reaching the stem might be complex These are mainly minor quibbles and they should be overcome with experienceWith all that in mind its simple to argue that Google has designed the most excellent gesture control system for headphones available today The AirPods Pro is undoubtedly capable but when compared to the Pixel Buds Pro there is an obvious winnerPixel Buds pro vs Airpods Pro  Battery lifeIn terms of battery life Google easily outperforms Apple The Pixel Buds Pro has a 7hour ANC playtime 25 hours longer than the AirPods Pro By disabling the function you can play for an additional 11 hours When ANC is turned off the AirPods Pro only adds 30 minutes to your battery life Furthermore Googles charging case contains more portable power depending on how you utilize their buds The AirPods Pro has a maximum battery life of 24 hours All of these cases support wireless charging and rapid chargingGoogle oddly did not provide a charging wire with the Pixel Buds Pro but it isnt enough of a detractor to deny the Pixel Buds this victoryDo Pixel Buds Pro work with iPhoneThey are compatible with any standard Bluetooth device including PCs and iPhones but contain Androidspecific functionsIs it worth getting Airpod pros with AndroidMost crucially the two main enhancements that make the new AirPods

disclaimer I have owned all of the Pixels as well as Samsung S3 S5  S7  S8 iPhone X and other phones going back to the OG HTC Evo I do use Android for personal and iOS for workI picked up a Pixel 4 at 400 off during Black Friday as 16mo was too tempting for me to pass up even though I do already have a 3 Ive watched and read countless Pixel 4 reviews and my comparison below is for those who are in a similar boatx200B1 Display  Pixel 3 80    Pixel 4 85   1 My Orange 4s display is warmer comparable in brightness but otherwise still pleasing whereas my 3 and my wifes 3 are both calibrated with a cooler temp   2 Viewing angles and color shift is mild and comparable between the two   3 As a 144hz PC guy 90Hz on a phone is the real deal as its really smooth and satisfying to scroll around The 4s rounded edges are significantly more rounded compared to the 3 so it squishes the quick setting pulldown icons at the top2 Unlocking  Pixel 3 fingerprint 90    Pixel 4 face 85   1 The fingerprint reader on the 3 is still awesome but even with Motion Sense radar turned off the 4 is still pretty fast at unlocking and getting right into the phone without having to swipe or anything It does work in most lighting but sometimes Ive had to try more than once in pitch black while in bed   2 The eyes closed face unlock issue is silly to me  you can fingerprint unlock the 3 with your eyes closed too or when the person is asleep you can place the phone on someones finger and access the phone This biometric locking is good for a layer of security for using your phone regularly while not having to punch in codes or patterns and its a good first defense if your phone is left unattended or stolen Its not meant to be a bulletproof security feature As a side note you can add the Lockdown option in the power button menu to disable biometric unlock and require the user to enter in the pin or pattern to unlock the phone the next time   3 Some apps have updated to use face unlock Bank of America but some still havent Paypal Not a deal breaker and I imagine there will eventually be parity but its still not there yet3 Camera  Pixel 3 90    Pixel 4  90   1 This is obviously subjective and theyre both providing virtually identical experiences I have AB compared normal pics zoomed in pics and 4K videos and theyre all pretty close between the two phones The 4 is still a great camera but it isnt much of an improvement over the 3 and HDR processing still takes a bit of time on the 4   2 Some folks have said that the 4 tends to use a slightly longer exposure time in identical lighting conditions compared to the 3 which leads to blurrier shots and Ive seen this happen a few times in the past few days while indoors As a parent to little kids I wouldnt mind if Google rolled out a fast motion camera mode that lowers the exposure time and cranks up the ISO at the cost of a grainier picture to minimize blurriness of moving kids   3 I probably wont ever take pictures of the sky so Im not really giving the 4 much in the way of credit or bonus points   4 I did pick up a Moment case and wide angle lens and using it with Portrait mode has been kind of amazing The depth and bokeh are still on point but you can get more in the shot and obviously normal wide shots are possible as well4 Overall daily performance  Pixel 3 80    Pixel 4 90   1 Overall my 3 does pretty well in normal daily tasks Its generally smooth though it will sometimes hiccup if I have music playing and I want to take a quick picture but overall its pretty good   2 My 3 definitely chugs in certain situations In my car with Android Auto on Google MapsNavigation running and Spotify playing the music on the 3 absolutely skips and lags as I switch apps and with a rideshare app active the problem is even worse   3 So far in my anecdotal testing the 4 does not have these issues It seems to be solid with whatever I throw at it so it may be a combination of 6 GB of RAM and better RAM management5 Battery Life  Pixel 3 60    Pixel 4 60   1 In a typical day I average around 1620 hours with 4 hours screen on time with my 3 and in two days with a nearly identical setup in terms of launcher apps and usage the 4 seems to be about the same with Motion Sense turned off People have been saying how bad the battery is and if you can only get about 3 hours of SOT over a day that to me is not enough I know that Motion Sense is one of the newly touted features but I dont see myself using it all that often so after a day Ive turned it off   2 Yesterday I hit 16 hours with 5 hours 10 minutes of SOT and also an hour talking on the phone and I was still at 16 before I plugged it in About 6 of those hours were me sleeping however and we all know that battery will drain more if youre out and about and the phone is constantly connecting to various towers   3 Standby time was pretty steady at around 08hour overnight with the 3 and the past two nights it has been about 10hr so its in the same ballpark Not great but not awful either6 Other little things Google Assistant Sound Quality Bells and Whistles  Pixel 3 80    Pixel 4 80   1 EDIT Unlimited Original Quality backup in Google Photos is gone with the 4 This is a huge bummer and Ive lowered the Pixel 4 score from 90 to 80   2 Google Assistant is good on both devices particularly with the squeeze feature Local Assistant is definitely faster on the 4 and but at least for me continued conversation isnt fully working   3 Motion Sense is kind of cool and it seems to work pretty well when switching songs on Spotify I guess I just dont see myself skipping tracks all day long and needing to use this radar feature Its a small win for the 4 in its current form but if Google adds more functionality and it works well it would be a bigger differentiator   4 Live transcribe on the 4 is pretty awesome but I dont know how much Id use it Perhaps in a noisy environment where I dont want to crank the speakers or cant hear well it would be useful   5 The Recorder on the 4 is great though I have an APK for it installed on my 3 and it is working well on both devices   6 Speaker sound quality is good on both phones I honestly dont miss the 3s bottom speaker being directly front facing and the sound seems to be a little better rounded out on the 4 as well   7 Headphone sound quality is comparable between the two at least to my ears directly out to some Shure SE535 earphones Its good not the best but I have no issues with this   8 I havent had any real issues or seen differences in signal strength LTE or WiFi speeds bluetooth connection problems or anything of that nature7 Overall build quality and design  Pixel 3 80    Pixel 4 80   1 My 3 had two warranty issues  the bottom speaker stopped working and then in the refurb there was a speck of dust in the rear camera lens I now have a basically perfect working 3 and overall the build quality is good Button clicks feel good speakers are solid and its a sturdy design in that it survives JerryRigs extreme bend test   2 My 4 doesnt seem to have any issues at the moment but it has only been a few days The buttons feel great to press the matte finish on the sides and back are great and I could totally see myself using this phone without a case while around the house The fragile glass on the top of the 3 pretty much kept me from going caseless On the surface I like the 4s design better but it didnt survive the admittedly extreme bend test that the 3 could withstand so Im giving both phones a solid 8   3 As a side note my wife puts her phone in her back pocket all the time and can sometimes sit down ouch so that alone is a reason for her to stick with a 3 instead of going with the 4Overall unweighted scores  Pixel 3 80    Pixel 4 814Overall the 4 is definitely an iterative upgrade from the 3 Paying full price is probably a nogo unless youre swimming in cash but if you picked it up during Black Friday or you can get a good tradein with an old phone I think its a nice upgrade Daytoday usage with the 90 hz screen along with better RAMmanagement make this phone very enjoyable to use and while Im still in the honeymoon phase I have no regrets picking up this 4","66":" Sorry for the long post but theres a lot to rant aboutSo  I just spent 800 AUD and bought a pixel 2 xl during Christmas because everyones calling it the BEST phone of 2017 and that stock android was the way to go I was partially aware of the screen issues but many  posts on reddityoutube etc claimed  the display is not a big issueOverall  I regretted buying the pixel 2 XL I just graduated and is still  looking for a full time job so 800 meant a lot to me I plan to use my  phone for  3 years so its a long term investment My goal was to buy a  smooth phone as my 3 years old s6 edge would occasionally stutter in  day to day useBottom line is no headphone jack no wireless charging no sd card slots ok I can make  compromise and live without these But 800 for a clearly DEFECTIVE  display is inexcusable Other phones may have their drawbacks eg  samsung with slow updates iphone no jack and etc BUT they dont have  large scale QUALITY issues  Im upset many people just gave Google a  free pass because of the smooth ui  and the great camera I regret that I  didnt believe the vocal minority before but now I see that the pixel  2 xl panel is clearly DEFECTIVE I dont understand how Google are still able to sell them despite all the screens quality issues1 First  thing I noticed no usb c headphones in box My friend bought a pixel 3  recently and that came with a usb c headphones All of my past phones  has had earphones in box Ok just ranting so far no big deal2 Firing  up my pixel 2 xl I immediately noticed the grain on the phone which  wasnt present on my s6 edge They are quite visible especially under  white  background I was a bit disappointed Im not gonna start on the  blue shift issue since I was well aware of it3   I put my phone on a grey background to check for panel issues and  noticed the panel has an uneven lighting Its subtle but noticeable  Again had no such issues on my s6 edge Im upset by this point as I  just laid down 800 bucks for it4  I have a calibrated SRGB monitor as my hobbies include drawing and  photography so accurate colors means a lot to me The s6 edge on BASIC  display mode looks very close to my calibrated monitor The pixel 2 XL  on NEUTRAL MODE has a much more muted color Eg the red looks very  brownish compared to my calibrated monitor despite google claimed it  was color accurate I find this deceptive claim from google disturbing  as its obviously not color accurate5 Display is dim under direct sunlight on adaptive and max brightness My s6 edge had no such issues on max brightness6  Personally I think stock android is not that great Yeah its smooth  notice I didnt say its fast but its bare bone On pie gestures are  half baked compared to my friends who have oneplus and iphone xsmax  Gesture on pie take up space just like navbar and there is no way to  auto hide it I had to pay 3 bucks and buy the XDA gesture app from play  store and use ADB to hide the nav barbtw I rly liked the split pills  gestures Other phones like LGOneplus and Samsung all include such  basic options to hide the nav bar Why is such a basic option not  available on stock android Other things like cant customise AOD also  kinda bothers me7  Audio quality isnt great through the headphone adapter I compared it  with my friends iphone xsmax using his Shure monitor earphones the  sound on the iphone xsmax is def more detailed and louder both at low  volMy  pixel 2 xl is on its way back to google as of now no adv RMA since I  didnt buy it directly from google and Im left without a phone for 2  weeks","67":"Hey guys I am here seeking advice before buying Pixel 3a I actually do like what 3a is offering for its price I just have one doubt in mind that I need to clear before buying it Many reviewers have complained about the bad audio quality from 35 mm jack Is that true I mean how good or bad is it as compared to something like my current phone iphone 7 And does the quality improve if I use wireless earphones sorry if thats a dumb question I am not a techie person I am no audiophile but I like to listen to a lot of music and so I expect my new smartphone to sound atleast better than my current iphone7 which was released almost 3 years before pixel 3 Please help me get over the dilemmaThank you","68":"Hi all I am from Lima  Peru I decided not to enter Reddit for a week to test the new pixel buds 2 that I acquired on Friday August 28 around 100 pm The post will be long I think please be patientFirst I must say that the PBs are my second wireless headphones In January of this year I bought the Xiaomi Redmi Airdots whose value in local currency is 69 soles  20 These Redmi Airdots I paired with a Huawei Mate 10 and their use was frustrating Outdoor calls are horrible and the left earbud was constantly disconnecting from the device whether indoors or outdoors Although I must admit that calls in closed places were acceptable In March I found a post in the Xiaomi forums from a user that taught steps to follow to improve the connection  and believe me it improved a lot if before I gave it a rating of 510 now it increased to 70  10 although the calls on the street were still horribleAt the beginning of July they assaulted me yes Lima is an unsafe city fortunately the thief only took my smartphone I kept the Airdots and the Mi Band 4  a few days later I acquired a Xiaomi redmi note 8 I thought that at being from the same brand the hearing aids would pair even better  It wasnt the connection is a bit unstable and my rating of these redmi airdots dropped to 65  10 Sorry if you find it tedious to continue reading my story about other hearing aids but now I start with the pixel budsSince I learned about the FirstGeneration Pixel Buds I fell in love with them I tried many times to buy a pair through ebay Google Store and other means without success but when I found out that a new generation would come out my excitement rose to the maximum But with all this Covid 19 my hopes were dashedFew days after buying my new redmi note 8 I found a local seller who had the PB I could not believe it I contacted him but I was not sure about buying them the reason All the posts here on Reddit that I read totally put me off I told the seller that I would think about it for a while I even made a post asking for advice if it was a good idea or not to buy a pair being me from Peru I really hoped that the new firmware or the new buds colors would improve the experience of many even if it was the minority and yes  the few positive posts or comments encouraged me to buy itI said to myself in case the PB are rubbish I will imagine that they robbed me or I lost the money etc I contacted the seller again we met outside his house 0 and he gave me the product it cost me 900 soles  253 I was very nervous so much that I stayed watching them for an hour without daring to open them I didnt know whether to use them in my home or on the street To hell I said to myself again I opened the box and saw the egg D I was surprised by how good it feels to the touch the premium finish of its manufacture I was even more surprised by how heavy the case  charging egg is and the headphones with its matte finish is a caress for my fingertipsAs soon as I finished the initial configuration I checked the version the entire product was with firmware 297 while I was checking the app I received a call from my friend I thought it was a good idea to test them we talked for 2 hours I had no disconnections or anything similar and best of all my friend listened to me loud and clear it felt very good not to raise my voice practically when using the redmi airdots I was shouting in the street to be heard We finished talking and I tried the music it was unusable I couldnt hear even 10 seconds of song Minutes passed and I didnt even bother I knew that if the PBs had bugs it would be my fault for venturing to buy a product with many negative reviewsI got home I kept testing the audio playback I couldnt hear 20 seconds and everything was cuts cuts and more cuts I used the call again everything was fine the videos on YouTube the synchronization was perfect and curiously they did not have so many cuts when watching videos I entered Netflix specifically Better Call Saul Second Season Chapter 7 whose duration is approximately 42 minutes in that period I had 4 cuts 2 of them were micro cuts that were solved instantly and the other 2 I solved by restarting the bluetooth I said to myself  How is it possible that these headphones are good for calls good or decent for watching videos But not to listen to music Tired and without spirits I put them to charge and leave them unused for 2 hours when I took them out again I realized that it had been updated to version 550 with hope I tried the audio again and  yes the cuts continued In the same app I looked for help on connection  it only guided me from the first step unpairing the pixel buds from the smartphone I did it and a message appeared that had not appeared in the initial configuration it is the following BLUETOOTH CONNECTION  THE CURRENT DEVICE SUPPORTS THE AAC CODEC HOWEVER AAC MAY FAIL TO PLAY SOUND DUE TO COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS YOUR DEVICE AUTOMATICALLY CHANGED TO THE SBC CODECI remembered some posts here that talked about codecs and others Im honest  I dont know much about that but I did remember that before restarting them again in the Bluetooth options of my Redmi Note 8 the pixel buds connected with AAC format appeared And I figured switching from AAC to SBC would be a good sign and you know what IT WORKEDAfter that the pixel buds improved their connection On Saturday 29 I used them from 600 am900 am I had no cut at 1000 am I went out to the street specifically to the most boisterous places with many people throughout Lima I listened to music I spoke without effort by phone from 1000 am to 200 pm I had 6 tiny micro cuts that were automatically solved at 1430 pm if I had many cuts and could not listen to music 1431 pm I tried for a minute to reconnect them but I preferred to put them in the egg case I saw that they only had 20  and 22 battery in each hearing aid I assumed that maybe those small cuts were due to the low load of the headphones or that something was causing interference I was in a commercial area that more closely resembles going out of a concert with a lot of people around walking or selling things on the street by 233 pm They were in the case and 1444 I took them out again each hearing aid had 75 battery I continued listening to music without problems from 244 pm to 400 pm  from 700 pm to 1100 pm only a micro cut tinyOn Sunday I practically did not have any cuts at home I used them at home for several hours and everything was excellentOn Monday I used them in the street around 900 am to 200 pm and I had little interference I got home and charged them for 20 minutes already at night around 800 pm the left earphone was disconnected apparently because the battery was drained before the rightOn Tuesday it rained in Lima I had no interference in the street I used them for several hours All goodFor Wednesday I went to coastal places near the sea the wind was blowing very strong I also used them for hours I only had 2 disconnections interferences I think because of the strong wind but everything was very good In the afternoon I charged them for 20 minutes and had around 70 in both hearing aids but at an hour and twenty the left hearing aid went down to 15 and the right one was at 50 I dont know why although later the right hearing aid began to balance lets say with the leftYesterday Thursday I went out again from 1037 am to 257 pm I had very few cuts but everything was perfectToday I went out to ride a bike unfortunately I could not test it well I left my home around 400 pm in 3 minutes I arrived at an ATM to withdraw money in that time I sent messages by WhatsApp to my girlfriend while driving it worked very well then I kept driving  I called my sister the call was very good all this in less than 12 minutes then I opened Spotify I put on the last album of the strokes and in the middle of The Adults Are Talking the tire got flat I got too angry because I can only ride my bike once a week and I really wanted to test the PBs by riding in the air I had to walk 40 min carrying my bike to the side and the worst thing was that I had interference listening to music maybe 5 or 6 inBrooklyn Bridge to Chorus and that made me even angrier I dont know if it was bad luck or I was already sweaty or because of the roughness and weight when walking caused these interferences Perhaps in the future I will repeat this testTHE ADVANTAGES FOR ME ARE THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE I HAVE HAD THEM FOR MANY HOURS AND HAVE NOT HAD PROBLEMS OR PAIN IN THE EARS I DO NOT PLUG MY EARS AND THAT HELPS FOR CALLS I SPEAK WITHOUT EFFORT WHY I DONT FEEL THAT THE OTHERS ON THE STREET LISTEN TO ME OR SEE ME AS CRAZY SPEAKING ALOUD THE TOUCH CONTROLS ARE EXCELLENT EASY TO SUIT THEM THE VOICE ASSISTANT IS VERY HELPFUL JUST SAYING OK GOOGLE OR HEY GOOGLE OR PRESSING WITHOUT LEAVING AND INDICATING WHAT YOU WIN IS INCREDIBLE IN FACT THATS WHY I WANTED SO MANY PIXEL BUDS BECAUSE OF ITS INTEGRATION WITH GOOGLE ASSISTANTBECAUSE OF MY CURRENT JOB SOMETIMES I CANNOT USE MY OWN PHONE WITH MY HANDS AND THIS REALLY HELPS ME A LOT EVEN MORE THAN LIMA IS AN UNSAFE CITY AND POST PANDEMIA HAS GOTTEN WORSE USE YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOUR HANDS TO SEND A MESSAGE TO YOU GIRLFRIEND FRIENDS OR MAKING CALLS IS VERY IMPORTANT  MIND NOTE I HOPE SOME DAY I CAN TRAVEL TO JAPAN AND I CAN FEEL WHAT A SAFE CITY IS THE VOICE ASSISTANT OR ACTIVATING IT WITH THE OK GOOGLE ON THE STREET WORKS 95 FOR ME SEWES IT DOES NOT WORK WELL BUT I THINK IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE 2 MASKS AND MAYBE THAT IS WHY IT DOES NOT CAPTURE THE MAGIC WORD WELL BUT PRESSING AND HOLDING TO ACTIVATE THE ASSISTANT GOES TO 100 AND INDOORS IF THE VOICE ACTIVATION WORKS 100 THE CALLS ARE VERY GOOD I AM VERY HAPPY THAT NOW IF THEY CAN HEAR ME ON THE STREET  SEVERAL FRIENDS HAVE TOLD ME THEY LISTEN TO ME PERFECTLY AND THAT THE MICROPHONES ARE NOT LIKE AIRPODS OR OTHER BRANDS WITH STICK THE SOUND IS VERY GOOD FOR THOSE WHO SAY IT IS NOT SO STRONG THEY JUST RAISE THE VOLUMEM TO THE PB AND THEIR MOBILE DEVICE THE PB HAVE A GOOD BALANCE WITH THE FIRMWARE 297 THE BASS WERE SUBTLE BUT I COULD NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE NEW FIRMWARE 550 WITH THE INCREASED BASS AND IF IT SHOWSTHE DISADVANTAGES FOR ME ARE THOUGH I SAID ABOVE THAT THE COVER LOOKS PREMIUM TO ME I ALSO FEEL THAT I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF IT LIKE GOLD WITHOUT COVER GOODBYE PIXEL BUDS BY ITSELF I AM A PERSON WHO TAKES CARE OF HIS THINGS MY PREVIOUS HUAWEI IN ALMOST 2 YEARS AND MEDIO NEVER FELL ON THE FLOOR AND ETC I FEEL THAT THESE PIXEL BUDS I MUST TAKE CARE OF THEM LIKE GOLD IT GIVES ME ANXIETY TO THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE I MAY BE DAMAGED EITHER BECAUSE OF MY DIFFICULTY OR BY CHANGING THE CONFIGURATION OR BECAUSE A NEW GOOGLE FIRMWARE APPEARS THAT MALOGUE THE EXPERIENCE SO BY FINISHING WRITING THIS POST I WILL DEACTIVATE THE UPDATES OF FIRMWARE I KNOW THAT I SHOULD NOT GIVE IT A LOT OF IMPORTANCE BUT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE NEVER SPENT ON SUCH EXPENSIVE HEADPHONES I KNOW THAT THINGS DO NOT LAST FOREVER BUT I PRETEND THAT THESE PB LAST FOR 2 OR 3 YEARS I HOPE THERE IS ALREADY CURE FOR COVID BY THAT DATE I AM BRONZE THAT IN MY COUNTRY THERE IS NO GOOGLE STORE HERE IN LIMA THERE ARE APPLESTORE SAMSUNG STORE XIAOMI STORE HUAWEI STORE ETC BUT THERE IS NO GOOGLE STORE I WOULD LIKE IT TO HAVE A PHYSICAL STORE OR SUPPORT FOR MY COUNTRY WITH AVAILABLE TECHNICAL SERVICE IN CASE IT IS BAD OR SIMPLY TO BUY NEW GOOGLE PRODUCTS I WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE A PIXEL 4 OR FUTURE MODELS IN LIMA I REPEAT IT IS HARD TO GET GOOGLE PRODUCTS ALTHOUGH I ADMIT THAT WITH TIME MANY DEVICES LIKE CHROMECAST AND GOOGLE NEST ARE BEING SOLD ANOTHER DISADVANTAGE IS THAT THE BATTERY IS IRREGULAR WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE CASE FOR A LONG TIME AND I USE THEM THEY GIVE ME 4 HOURS 4 HOURS AND A HALF APPROXIMATE I DID THE TEST OF CHARGING THEM 10 MINUTES AND THEY WILL GIVE ME 2 HOURS BUT IN REAL LIFE IT ONLY GAVE ME 1 HOUR AND A HALF  WITH 10 MIN OF CHARGE OF 15 17 THEY RISE TO 74 76 BUT IT ONLY GAVE ME FOR TIME AND TWENTY MINUTES AND THE SOUND OF LOW BATTERY BEGINS WHEN THEY WERE IN THE CASE FOR 30 MIN OR A LITTLE MORE ANYONE WOULD ASSUME THAT YOU WILL HAVE MORE HOURS OF BATTERY LIFE ON WEDNESDAY I MEET THEM FOR 50 MINUTES AND LAST 3 HOURSI USE THE PIXEL BUDS WITH A XIAOMI REDMI NOTE 8 ANDROID 9 VERSION WITH MIUI 11 I KNOW THAT IN A FEW DAYS I WILL HAVE THE NEW MIUI 12 UPDATES BUT I WILL THINK VERY WELL IF I SHOULD UPDATE IT OR NOT I hope I have the freedom to decide I do not want to spoil my experience with these PB I USE BLUETOOTH WITH A MI BAND 4 AND WITH PIXEL BUDS THE AUDIO CODEC IS SBC I HAVE PINNED THE PIXEL BUDS APPLICATION IN THE BACKGROUND I HAVE DISABLED THE AUTOMATIC FIRMWARE UPDATE AND I HAVE DISABLED THE UPDATE OF PLAYSTORE APPLICATIONS I HAVE ENABLED THE BASS REINFORCEMENT I HAVE DISABLED THE EXPERIENCE DETECTION FOR THE LISTENING FUNCTION AND THE LISTENING DETECTION A BABY OR ALARMS ALSO HAVE THEM DISABLED AH AND THE AMBIENT SOUND ALSO HAVE IT DISABLEDTO GO OUT TO THE STREET I USE A MALENTIN  BACKPACK  BACKPACK I HATE CARRYING THINGS IN THE POCKETS OF THE TROUSERS SO I PUT EVERYTHING IN THERE SOMETIMES I CARRY THE BACKPACK FULL AND THE CONNECTION IS VERY GOOD IN MY HOUSE I HAVE NOT WALKED AWAY SO MUCH FROM THE DEVICE TO THE MOST 1 METER OR 2 I IGNORE THAT SUCH IS THE CONNECTION IN LONG DISTANCES I HAVE WEARED A HAT  HOOD AND EVERYTHING WAS PERFECTLYI HAVE NOT USED THE TRANSLATOR I DONT KNOW THAT IT IS THAT GOOD I HAVE NEITHER USED THE PAIRING WITH ANOTHER ANDROID DEVICE OR WITH ANY WINDOWS PC ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKEAPOLOGIZE AGAIN IF I EXCEEDED BUT I REALLY WANTED TO TELL IN DETAIL THIS EXPERIENCE I DIDNT WANT TO OPEN THE BOX TO USE THEM FOR 5 OR 10 MINUTES AND SAY THEY ARE AMAZING EDIT I ALREADY GOT TROUBLE LIKE OTHERS POST THIS THAT YOU READ ME IN ANALYZING THEM I EVEN THINK ILL KEEP DOING IT I WAITED FOR THESE HEARING AIDS FOR MONTHS AND THEY REALLY ARE AMAZING I HOPE I DONT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS I WILL CROSS MY FINGERSMY PERSONAL SCORE FOR THESE PIXEL BUDS IS 910MAYBE IM GIVING YOU A LOT BUT I HAVE NEVER USED A HIGHEND AIRPOD  AIRPOD PRO  JABRA  SONY  ETC MY OTHER OPTION FOR ANDROID WAS THE GALAXY BUDS LIVE OR PLUS BUT AS I SAID HAVE THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT FOR EVERYTHING ITS GREAT I HOPE MORE USERS CAN IMPROVE THEIR CONNECTION I ALSO HOPE THAT THE ASSISTANTS NAME CAN BE CHANGED FOR EXAMPLE OK JARVISI ALSO HOPE THAT THE ASSISTANT CAN SEND AUDIO MESSAGES FOR WHATSAPP TELEGRAM OR ETC WITH THE FIRST CONFIGURATION THE ONE THAT GIVEN ME FAILURES WHEN RECEIVING A NOTIFICATION IT EMITS A SOUND AND SEVERAL SMALL SOUNDS IF IT WAS FROM THE SAME APP WHEN PERFORMING THE SECOND PAIRING SUCCESSFUL THAT NOTIFICATION SOUND STOPPED NOW TO BE ISSUED ASSISTANT TELLS ME WHAT APP NOTIFICATION IS IT IS IT RAREPD1 AH I FORGOT THE PIXEL BUDS I HAVE ARE WHITEPD2 I dont use PBs for gaming latency in videos is fine for mePD3 Sorry for the writing I wrote everything in Spanish and used Google translator greetings","69":"Ive been using the regularsized iPhone 11

a notch just like the iPhone Xstyle phones have had for the last few years now They want to optimize for screen space so theyre taking those extra corners if they can get them Apples stuck with glossy glass on the 11 proper but textured now on the 11 Pro It has a big honking bump with two cameras on the 11 three on the Pro colormatched to the glass color but with gloss and texture inverted The result is what it usually is a phone thats almost a singular objecthttpswwwimorecompixel4vsiphone11whichphoneshouldyougetPixel has a forehead like some Pixels have had before except for the one with last years random notch Theyre optimizing for clean lines and consistency between devices now Googles gone from the twotone to single tone and textured And it also has a big honking bump with two cameras colormatched to the cameras Which means black The result is almost an iPhonestyle singular object but still with a playfully colored power buttoniPhone displays have consistently been great for years and the iPhone 11 LCD and iPhone 11 Pro OLED are no exceptions They use Samsungs process Apples spec calibration and management and theyre some of the best in the business Theyve also had TrueTone ambient color temperature matching for a while now Basically Apple wants consistency across the board All color just handledPixel displays have faced more challenges The Pixel 2 XL display was bad Pixel 3 was much better Pixel 4 is supposed to be excellent Rumor has it theyre also using Samsungs process now but with their own color management and so its quite possible theyre right up there as well And theyve just added Ambient EQ which also matches color temperature So Googles now matching Apple in the color matchingBut the Pixel displays now go up to 90hz with dynamic refresh

to just come out and say is the best mobile silicon on the market today And inserting the word mobile in there is becoming less and less necessary over time Also 4 GB of RAM If benchmarks are your thing it scores 1329 for singlecore and 3411 multicore on Geekbench 5httpswwwimorecompixel4vsiphone11whichphoneshouldyougetApple believes in fully integrated features from the chip to the interface so custom silicon is just an investment that keeps paying off Combined with increased display efficiency and bigger batteries 3110 mAh for the iPhone 11 3046 mAh for the iPhone 11 Pro and 3969 mAh for the iPhone 11 Pro Max it gives all of this years iPhones real allday battery life You can also get up to 512 GB of storage if you like to hoard all the bitsThe Pixel 4 uses Qualcomms Snapdragon 855 Not the 855 but its probably not enough difference for anyone to really care about After getting kicked in the 64bit butt by the A7 Qualcomm has really started pushing again and while I dont think theyre in Apples silicon league yet theyre finally catching up Also 6 GB of RAM which is way up from the previous 4 GB and should make a big difference with AndroidI havent seen any scores for the Pixel 4 but the 855 on the OnePlus 7 Pro tops out at 723 single and 2655 multicore on Geekbench 5 So even if Google works some magic its fair to say theyre not getting close And they have a history of performance degradation over time Fingers crossed thats fixed To make up for the lack of custom SoC Googles working on custom coprocessors More on that in a minute But still it necessitates a modular playThe Pixel 4 has a 2800mAh battery and the Pixel 4 XL 3700mAh Which is kind of worrisome given Pixels have never exactly been known for their battery life to begin with In other words if they last theyre going to have to prove it Also they top out at 128 GB on storageSecurityBy now the iPhones Aseries Secure Enclave and Face ID facial geometry scanner are well known Face ID debuted on the iPhone X and has been made faster with subsequent hardware and software updates including on the iPhone 11 You cant however use it without having to swipe up on the lock screen to openThe Pixel has Googles Titan security chip and a new facial geometry scanner augmented by a MotionSense radar chip And yes there was a huge controversy surrounding how the data was obtained for the face scan so factor that in as you willMuch like Apples new U1 spatial positioning chip in the iPhone 11 Google hasnt said much if anything about what the MotionSense killer feature will be Apple is rumored to be shipping locator tags at some point Until then both are tech demosFor now it will preload the camera for Face unlock and you can use it without having to swipe up on the lock screen to open In fact you have to change a setting if you want the lock screen to linger which makes the experience perceptively fasterCameraApple went from a single wideangle or dual wideangle and telephoto to dual 12mp

selfie cameras but its now 8mp with a 90 field of view Basically the Pixel 4 has hohum camera hardware but excellent computeApple has gotten better at fusion and semantics Google at virtual lens modeling and depth data Googles also using a Pixel Neural Core which finally  finally \u00a0gives them the processing power necessary to do live previews of all the computational photography Something the iPhone has done since 2016 The Pixel is just crushing it on computational Super Zoom though which is an area Apple hasnt really focused on yetBoth have computational high dynamic range night mode and astrophotography Which you like better will come down more to subjective factors namely whether you prefer Apple or Googles color science and artistic choices Apple has traditionally gone for a natural look and feel Thats led to warmer tones Google feels like they want scientific accuracy which has led to slightly cooler tones Again its a matter of personal preference at this pointVideo is a different story The iPhone still does 4K 60 fps but now with extended dynamic range Even on the frontfacing camera The Pixel 4 is still tops out at 4K 30 fpsTheres a lot lot more to both cameras of

autoinstalling appsAfter using a Pixel for the first time though Ive come to realize this thing is just as polished as my iPhone was If not more If anything the above issues are almost exclusively Samsung issuesFor example1 ClunkinessAndroid for a long time now has allowed the user to use navigation gestures The average nontechy user prefers this and the average iPhone switcher definitely does too considering it operates the same way their iPhone didKeep in mind that most people typically never change the default settings Why then do Galaxy phones default to the clunky old 3 button navigation bar hiding the gesture bar under several deep menus The average consumer wants the gesture bar and so the Pixel and hell many other Android brands use it by default2 BloatwareIts simply a fact that Samsung ships way too many apps on their devices For almost every software service theres a good chance youll have three stock options the Google app you want to use the Samsung copy of that app you dont want to use and a Microsoft app on there for some unknown reason Google Photos Samsung Gallery Microsoft OneDrive WhyThe fact of the matter is when the average consumer uses a phone and opens a file they dont want to be bombarded with 3 different options They want that file or that action to just happen Seamlessly If they wanted OneDrive or Word or Samsung Internet theyd go download it3 Ads and autodownloadsBy default an unlocked Galaxy Aseries will autodownloads apps you never asked for occasionally It will also feed you ads in your notifications Whats worse is that carrierlocked S and Z phones the flagship Galaxy devices will still do this This is horrible for the user experience  one should NEVER have to deal with being served an ad by their very own operating system let alone forced to install applications This is why Windows 11 is getting so much hateCompare all of this to the Pixel Or really any stock Android phone The Pixels got a clean simple interface with one design language one ecosystem of apps a fluid and easy to navigate gesture system and zero inbuilt ads and autoinstallers This is what stock Android is unbloated by Samsung and One UI And its an amazing experienceAll these software issues the Galaxy series have are bad enough on their own However combining them with this one extra fact makes them significantly worseGalaxy phones outsell every other Android brand combined in the USThe average American consumer will buy an Android end up with a Galaxy and end up with an absolutely terrible user experience Whats next Theyre not buying a Pixel or a OnePlus Samsung defines an Android to them and Samsung failed their needsTheyre buying an iPhone afterward and never looking backiPhones have a 80 market share among young Americans And theyre growing The only competitor making a dent in that 20 is Samsung and their horrific user experience hemorrhages market share to Apple every quarterSamsungs strategy isnt working The iPhone is pushing them to a breaking point and the Pixel is growing in from the other side","72":"They knew from the beginning where I am situatedMy 6as mic 1 stopped working after recent updateThey told me I should send them bills personal details and so onThen they told me I will receive a direct switch phone and after should send mine backThen they said this wont work cause of my countryThey said I should send my phone for repairs I said okay will have not phone for 3 weeks or more but better than nothingThey replied that also this option THEY JUST NOW SUGGESTED  wont be possible im central europe and never answered againEU has consumer rights I am well in warranty and google LLC wont obey the law to repair their broken deviceThe support was as serious as being scammed by an IP scamI cant believe how a company with such a yearly net profit fucks over their customers I actually cant believe how their support is built up Its very very disturbing how self destructive they behaveGood bye Never was so disappointed","73":"Ive been an Android user for over a decade with a string of Pixels in recent years My last iPhone was the iPhone 3 I think so its been a long time Ive always liked the flexibility of Android plus the fact that Googles ecosystem isnt closedmeaning in theory I could switch to iPhone at any time without too much hassleBut my Pixel 7 had been giving me headaches especially with Google Messages failing to receive texts in group chats I dont know if it was the phone or my carrier but after months of frustration I finally gave in Seeing the sheer number of iPhones around me plus the way Apple is constantly hyped up in media I figuredwhy not Maybe I was missing outSo a week ago I used an upgrade from my carrier to get the iPhone 16 Pro Here are my thoughts so far How I Use My PhoneI use my phone for both work and personal life and a lot of that involves typingemails messaging across multiple apps etc I rely on crossplatform apps like WhatsApp Gmail Outlook Salesforce and many Google services Google News Drive Keep Gmail Maps YouTube Music etc The Good Hardware Quality A really nice piece of hardware Beautiful solid and feels great in hand The Pro model is a good sizebig but not too bulky Screen Looks fantastic No complaints Camera  Video Takes excellent shots and from all accounts the video quality is toptier Dynamic Island First time hearing about it but its actually pretty cool Having sports scores and music controls right there is surprisingly useful Software Touches Some effects and animations are really smoothlike when scanning a document it isolates the background and seamlessly moves it into the corner CarPlay This surprised me When catching up on notifications it gives a naturallanguage summary of missed messages which is really nice    The Apple Maps navigation voice and style is very natural and smoothI actually prefer it to Google Maps I guess the days of being navigated into a lake are over for Apple Maps Grouped Notifications While I still think Android does notifications better Apples grouping and summarization of sameapp notifications is intelligently designed and useful FaceID When youre holding the phone FaceID works perfectlyfast and accurate However if the phone is sitting on a desk or table FaceID often wont pick up your face unless you awkwardly lean over it A fingerprint reader would be a really nice option in those situations Standby Mode Standby mode at night with the bedside alarm clock in red was actually very nice and welldesigned Its subtle but easy to read at night without being harsh on the eyes Also the default iPhone alarm tone is exceptionally pleasingway better than the jarring tones Im used to on Android GenMoji Seems Fun I didnt even try it once but I bet its cool for those who are into that sort of thing The BadThese arent new complaints about iOS but for someone using it as a main device they are massive hurdles The Keyboard is Borderline Unusable Whether using the stock keyboard or Gboard on iOS the experience is awful So many typos wrong key pressesits just bad The Gboard on my old Pixel 7 was 1000x more accurate and faster to type on It has been consistently infuriating I had no idea just how much better the Android keyboard was Notifications  Anxiety Machine iPhone is aggressive with notificationsway more than I was used to On Android you can easily choose which notifications for a given app should be silent or not right from the notification itselfjust a quick tap and done On iPhone its a much more laborious process requiring you to dig into settings manually for each app This makes it way harder to finetune notifications to be useful instead of overwhelming Speaking of Settings Why is there a whole app called Settings instead of just swiping down and tapping an icon to adjust things quickly Having to navigate through an app for simple things like WiFi or Bluetooth is an unnecessary step No App Drawer This is insane Instead of a clean app drawer you have to either search for apps which is fine but not intuitive or look through Apples premade categories in the App Library The grouping seems neat at first glance but ends up being a wild choice in actual use Why do I have to rely on Apple to decide where my apps go CarPlay Layout is a Mess Apple Maps is actually pretty solid nownaturalsounding navigation accurate directionsbut the overall CarPlay interface is clunky compared to Android Auto    If you use Google Maps on CarPlay without a car screen just on your phone you can only get inapp media controls for Spotify or Apple Musicnot YouTube Music Why iMessage is Seriously Underwhelming I was expecting more RCS on Android does the same thing minus the blue bubble exclusivity so the fact that Apple has built an entire bullying ecosystem around this feels ridiculous WhatsApp does all of this and works across devices    No iMessage on a PC This was a shock I use a PC for work and I was stunned to realize that iMessage has no web or Windows version With Google Messages WhatsApp or basically any other modern messaging platform I could just open a browser and continue conversations while working With iPhone Nope Either use a Mac or be stuck switching between my phone and computer constantly Transferring Old Messages From Android Was a Nightmare This was infuriating Theres no native way to do it so I had to try a thirdparty expensive appand even that still didnt work Homescreen Organization is a Disaster On Android I can place apps and widgets where I wantmaybe I have a family photo as my wallpaper and dont want anything covering faces On iPhone Move one app and the whole homescreen shifts like a chaotic game of Tetris If you try to put an app in a folder its like chasing a toddler at bedtime Just why Final Verdict For NowAll of my complaints seem like they should be obvious to anyone who uses a phone regularly and heavily The keyboard alone makes the iPhone unusable for anyone who has used a functional mobile keyboard before The homescreen mess the notifications anxiety and the lack of a proper back gesture all add up to an experience that feels polished but deeply inefficientSo it appears Ill be switching back to Androidand a Pixel 9 Pro Im sure Ill still have complaints and yeah I know some grown adults will keep whining about green bubbles But whatever I need to get stuff doneWould love to hear from others who made the switch either way Did you stick with it or go back Does anybody ever switch any more","74":"Hey Pixel ownersJust wanted to share my experience using Google phones for a decade and also why i decided to give another brand a try for now TLDR I feel like ive been a beta tester for google since the Pixel 6 and upwardsIve been using google phones since the Nexus 6P and instantly fell in love with them The camera of the 6P was ahead of its time especially the ease of use My previous phones were Galaxies and these camera apps always had me take 4 or 5 pics before i snapped the right shot the 6P just made it into a one hit wonder I also loved the clean Android feel and seeing Android be improved to what it is today was an amazing journey Google phones i owned Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel 2 XL the panda 3 Pixel 3 Pixel 4 Pixel 3 again I loved the size Pixel 6  Pixel 8 and pixel watch  budsMy experience with Pixel phones has been outstanding especially in the beginning I was a BIG advocate of using Pixels and shilled them a lot They were a bit hard to come by in Holland at first so id import them Such great phones though I bought a Pixel 4 for my Mom that still works to this day No lag just smooth as butter I also loved the google ecosystem and the design language I still do I think android has really matured and is in so many ways pushing the envelope in smartphone OS development Im trying a different brand now but i do miss a lot of the features that android offers Its so smooth and navigating the phone is superb Universal back gesture now playing flip to DnD flick your wrist to reverse to selfie cam So many nifty ways to interact with your phone i love itThere has been a but in this story for me unfortunately Ever since the Pixel 6 the road has gotten a bit bumpy for me The 6 had strange issues would have excessive battery drain get really hot and have software bugs like apps hanging I loved these phones for the stability and this was getting a bit of an issue Maybe i was just unluckyI hoped it was a 6 issue so i upgraded to the regular 8  pixel watch 2 and this is were it really got crappy for me on the hardware spectrum The 8 had a few software issues like apps hanging when multitasking that i could live with but the hardware started failing me while traveling Japan First my Pixel Watch 2 just stopped charging and died on me out of the blue and a month later my Pixel 8 started getting a weird green screen issue tens of times a day the screen would just turn green and spaz out for a minute Very inconvenient when youre on a Japanese train station trying to figure out where to go Combine that with google maps hanging a lot when in PIP mode and it was beginning to become an annoyance to use the P8 on the roadGoogle supports solution was for them to send the phone in for repair which would mean i would be without a phone for 23 weeks so i was forced to buy a phone in Japan to travel without hassle I realised i kinda lost faith in the stability of my pixel because of my 6 and 8 experience so i decided to switch sides And i feel a bit sad to leave the Pixels behind to be honest I genuinely love these phones ive captured many great memories with em and theyve accompanied me on so many great adventures and never let me down Until recentlyNow having joined the other side still feels weird Its a gorgeous device to look at but i dont think the other brand has a better operating system and in lots of ways i miss my pixels ease of use Switching was not that difficult so i will definitely be back in the future but i really want Google to deliver a more stable hardware experience firstI feel like ive been a beta tester with these last 2 Pixels To get a support solution that involves not having my phone for 2 weeks is also very unsatisfactory And strange as my watch WAS able to be exchanged  but the watch is not really something i cant travel withoutI feel like with googles ambitions being upscaled theyre also upscaling some of the woes these phones have and its reflecting on the quality of my experiences I really hope the 9 will be a succes and makes me wanna jump back into the Pixel experience but i think im gonna skip a few generations Itll be good to fall in love with em again Anyway first world problems eh","75":"My current phone a Moto G Power is getting very laggy and at times just stuck such that I have to completely restart it to get out of whatever screen Im on Im looking to upgrade soon and I am considering the Pixel 8 or 8a likely 8a because the camera quality battery life continued updates for many years and good overall specs are attractive However I am hesitant to switch over to a Google phone because I pretty much only use Google Photos and the Google Calendar I dont search with Google I dont use Chrome I dont use the Assistant I dont use Docs etc Im also not very proAI and will probably not use the AI features very much though I suppose this depends on how helpful they end up beingIt also seems upon a little bit of research that you cannot get rid of the Google search bar at the bottom of the home screen which is a concern for me because I value customizability very much and dont search with Google anyhow Is this still the case If so I will have to opt for a different phone right now my second contender is the OnePlus 12RMy main question here is does the phone itself stand up when not very invested in the Google app ecosystem And as a subissue does it offer decent customization options or push you into using Google","76":"Pixel watch is not launched in India and i dont think so they will launch the pixel watch 2 too","77":"","78":"I am not a rich man I cant just go out and buy a new piece of tech every day like all of my favorite YouTubers There has to be research involvedI need to know what Im buying will keep me happy for longer than the 14 day return period So with 3 topend phones in my crosshairs the iPhone X the Pixel 2XL and the Note 8 I drudged through pages and pages of reddit reviews watched hours of video commentary and came to one conclusion I have no idea what phone to buy so why not try out all 3 Since Im a man of limited means Id have to try them out one at a time I started the upgrade process on my account and set my sights on the first prize the iPhone X  Xtra screen Xtra priceyThe iPhone X is arguably the most beautiful slab of glass and stainless steel Ive ever held in my hands The weight of the phone lets you know youve spent money on something well built I felt like when I had this thing out showing it off I was the center of attentionusually because I was It is a near perfect monument of what the path to the perfect iPhone has been for Apple The screen alone almost makes the phone worth it with its vivid punchy colors and amazing brightness The screen almost looks TOO good Like you can reach in and touch the icons The notch while noticeable for about 3 minutes just melts away I only noticed it when a video zoomed in past its pillar boxes Even then the notch didnt seem to upset me What did upset me was learning the gestures Some of them make sense swiping up from the bottom to close an app for instance But others like getting to the background apps felt slow and clunky And getting to the control center should be easier than it is Its not a one handed operation but I really feel it should be Sure if you have big hands like I do you can stretch your thumb out But if you have small hands its not going to be easy What made iOS great in the past was its simplicity and intuitiveness All of that seems to have been forgotten with the X and iOS 11 What has stayed simple though is Apples top notch bio metricsFaceID sounds like a bigger gimmick than square hamburger patties at Wendys I mean Android has had this for years right Wrong FaceID was easy to set up and quick to unlock The amazing subtle features that come with FaceID like hiding notifications on the lock screen until the phone recognizes you is just amazing I liked that I didnt have to position my face in some weird pose or angle for it to work either It just worked and thats what Apple people know and love Animojiswhile an even bigger gimmick were fun to play around with and really showcases what that front camera is capable of Speaking of Cameras both cameras did great the pics looked decently colored and I really love iOSs live photos with 3D touch Its about the only thing I used 3D touch for and its done well The video recording was very well done with 4k  60FPS being its biggest highlight The only thing I thought that wasnt well done was the OISto be honest I had to double check to make sure the phone HAD OIS because it didnt feel like it Hopefully that gets fixed in a software update Overall though the cameras can hold their own with the best that Android has to offer However after using the phone for a little bit I really felt cheated I was not seeing the smooth as silk iOS I had been told of for many years I was not getting top of the line battery life from a 1100 phone And as an android user for the last 6 years things just felt clunky navigating around the OS I missed things Ive taken for granted for years like my notifications with LEDs AOD and setting my own default apps Some of these things I could get adjusted to and I realize iOS 11 is going through a rough patch But all in all it just wasnt feeling like I could justify purchasing the X and telling myself to adapt to my phone instead of my phone adapting to meLets go back to the Android basics 2 XL styleBeing on ATT I couldnt just go into the store and subsidize a Pixel 2 XL That alone bugs me I HATE carrier exclusive phones Yes I know I can buy the phone direct from Google and thats good But theres something nice about going to a carrier store picking up the phone you want right there and walking out paying only sales tax with a big bill later Lucky for me one of my friends owns a shiney new Pixel 2 XL and let me play with it for a day Holy bananas this phone is snappyno snappy isnt good enough Its itsGoogle needs to invent a new word for how fast this phone feels Ive been on the Samsung train for most of my Android life with the Oneone and the Nexus 6 being the only two exceptions I honestly thought that the whole skipping frames and sluggishness you read about on the I hate Samsung train that is rAndroid was a bunch of nonsense Even my S7Edge felt fine to me No real slowdowns or anything Nope I was wrong WAAAAAY wrong The Pixel 2 XL felt like I had stepped out of a Toyota Corolla and into a Ferrari My friend laughed as I scrolled through the app drawer for minutes just saying its sooo smooth  From one Samsung fanboy to the rest of you out there your phone is slow you just dont realize it The camera was the other area this phone just steps out into its own I could not get it to take a bad photo to save my life Putting it against my other coworkers iPhone 8 she was even blown away by how the photos looked just like real life I briefly tried out the video functionality and cannot figure out how this camera manages to make better videos than phones with dual lens setups and OIS on everything except the user itself My only complaint about the camera was I didnt have a lot of shooting mode options Everything was very basic with just a couple of modes Google keeping it simple for the user definitely works for a lot of people but I do like having options like a manual modeThe Pixel 2s biggest controversy since its release is its less than stellar screen Once again coming from Samsung and even playing with the iPhone X I think Im a pretty good judge  when it comes to OLED displays I have almost nothing bad to say about the 2 XLs display The blueshift on the phone I tested didnt stand out to me as anything bad and really felt overblown especially when looking at other OLEDs I checked for light bleed and didnt see any And while my friends 2 XL is only a week old I didnt see any burn in or image retention but he does keep the brightness in check so as to not suffer the wrath of the burn in gods  Speaking of brightness this seems to be my only gripe with the screen At max brightness it just barely seemed to hang in there especially in direct sunlight While I could see what was on screen dark colors just merged together and details cant stand out Out of the 3 phones I tested this was by far the darkest screen Its great for indoors but I wasnt overly thrilled taking it outside   Now I fully admit I dont get the religious Pure Android or nothing attitude I see on Reddit I think OEM skins arent just nice but vital to forcing Google to incorporate the best of each skin into new iterations of Android AOD Multiapp display and a ton of other features in Android are thanks to LG Samsung and all the others out there pushing the limits of their vision of Android  That being said simple Android is pretty easy to use and Id even argue maybe even easier to use than iOS lately After tinkering with the 2 XL I can definitely see the appeal but I do and always will love feature rich skins that provide users with an even more engrossing and productive experience A noteworthy experience but can it lastMy final phone tested was the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 This phone is so big I had to get permits from the city just to let me put it in my house I kid but while expensive the Note 8 will at least leave you with the feeling you got a LOT for your money And you really do too That pen just keeps getting smarter every iteration of the Note line With it being able to do text translations and live messaging its a gimmick feature that I kept finding myself going back to I was looking for excuses to pull out the pen and do new things on the screenthat gorgeous beautiful screen Picasso once said Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot others transform a yellow spot into the sun Samsung has managed to create not another copy of an OLED display but THE OLED display for others to copy What the Note 8 lacks in fluidity and it does it makes up for in the most stunning display and feature rich experience in all of the 3 phones I tested From app pairing to cutting out sections of the screen drawing notes and then texting them faster than it took for me to write this sentence the Note 8 has abilities that would make a swiss army knife blush I was finding new things to do with the phone every time I picked it up Its almost overwhelming And therein lies the problem with Samsung vs Android purists Samsung weighs itself down with a constant influx of features at the expense of ram and processing power THANKFULLY Im happy to say that the Note 8 experience was a smooth one Not NEARLY as smooth as the Pixel 2 XL but Samsung has made ungodly strides in improving performance and it shows in the Note 8 Thats not to say there werent the occasional frame drop here and there now that I know what to look for with my Pixel experience I can hear what youre thinking Smooth now but give it a month or two and I would agree with you My Galaxy S6 was probably the worst offender in recent memory However I was able to compare the new Note 8 in my hand to another coworkers Note 8 theyve had since launch Everything seemed to be identical in terms of smoothness and the benchmarks were practically the same I tried to break both phones bogging them down with running apps music and video But to my surprise both phones held steady What didnt hold steady was the battery life I found it to be just barely ok I think that with quick charge we are becoming accustomed to fast charging top offs at the expense of sub par battery life Samsung really needs to address this in the next Note phone because a productivity phone that you use during the work day SHOULD be able to get you through the work day without the feeling of panic by 2 PM I hope Samsung shakes off the PTSD they gained from the Note 7 disaster We need battery innovation and the Note 8 is a great example of why Camera wise the Note 8 took great photos for a normal guy like myself But the iPhone X did a  better job and the 2 XL blew both of them out of the water The one area I felt the Note 8 shined over the other 2 was in video recording The image stabilization was excellent on the Note as well as the recorded sound quality While the iPhone Xs recorded sound was very quiet and the 2 XLs was very tinny the Note 8 had a very good balance of audio quality and ambient noise reduction This surprised me since I didnt think Samsung cared about sound because the Note comes with a single bottom firing speakerits 2017 Samsung stereo speakers are a thing Im sorry for yelling Samsungplease dont kill off the headphone jack Ok OkTLDR what did I pick While beautiful I couldnt get myself used to the Apple ecosystem so the X was out The 2 XL cant be purchasedsubsidized through ATTs Next program and I refuse to switch to Verizon so that was out Which leaves me with the Note 8 I loved all three phones for plenty of reasons and you CANT go wrong with any of them The iPhone X is a beautifulBEAUTIFUL work of art the Pixel 2 XL is a purist dream come true that is faster than any phone Ive ever played with and the Note 8 is a treasure trove of features and a display that will melt your eyes with its beauty  I count myself lucky to live in an age of these beautiful devices and am fortunate to be able to own one EDIT Thank you so much for the goldEDIT2 Fixed spelling errors and carrier skins to OEM skins  thanks uexelero88","79":"Im torn between getting the PIxel 8 Pro and the Iphone 15 Pro My current phone is Android a Xioami  never again the one before that was an Iphone 6S My dilemma is that Im heavily integrated into Google Email notes calendar and everything on google drive and I use google assistant I was just wondering if there are many ballsdeep google users who have IPhones and like the experience Can you use googles screencalls on the Iphone for exampleWhy dont I just get the PIxel 8 Pro then I hear you ask Well I dont like being rippedoff and I get the feeling that the hardware on the Pixel 8 isnt really flagship despite having a flagship price i also resent there being minimal diferences between the PIxel 8 and 8 pro more just software restrictions on the photo app The Tensor G3 chip compared to A17latest Snapdragon is poor and some of the flagship functionality of the Pixel 8 summarise article function for example is only available in the US and im from the UKwhich begs the question what else is missing for nonUs customersor will be missing in future updates the video on the Iphone is better I like the Idea of having Log format to shoot in toothough who knows if will really use it and I reckon the photos on both devices are basically comparable The iphone is however a very boring device compared to the PixelSo any heavy google users on the Iphone 15 Pro and like the experience compared to using it on a PixelNot strictly a PIxel question but someone here might have some insight","80":"I love my iPad and MacBook but I am really sick of the iPhone I am thinking of getting the Pixel 9 Pro but I worry about how this will impact my other devices ","81":"Why do you think that is finally iPhone users coming to their senses Form factor Tired of the same ole phone every yearIf anything I thought apple was genius for trapping their audience in their ecosystem black hole So for all of you iPhone users who switched after xxx years with apple why nowSimple curiosity not trying to stir the pot Edit Well didnt expect this type of response Certainly have gotten all sides of the argument in the commentsForgive my tackiness in not trying to stir the pot coinciding with iPhone users coming to their senses Just to clarify my poorly worded post I did post this in curiosity of the people who are switching and do appreciate the opposing side android to iPhone In no way do I think that the amount of iPhone to Android posts represent the factual numbers nor do I not believe that there are android to iPhone switchersHowever thank you for entertaining the post Its been a pleasure to read everyones perspective","82":"Ive been a diehard iPhone user since 2019 My last venture into the Android world was with the Google Pixel 2 XL a phone I genuinely liked for many reasons Fast forward to now Ive been using the Google Pixel 8 for a month and honestly Im thinking about my next phone already But heres the catch  Im also considering what Id miss if I switchedThis post isnt about bashing the Pixel Instead I want to hear from you What do you love about your Pixel What keeps you loyal despite the occasional bug or setbackFor me some Pixelexclusive features are hard to let go of The Now Playing the handy call screening and the seamless Google ecosystem integration are all compelling But theres always that nagging thought of switching back to iPhone or trying a Samsung for the first time everSo Pixel fans why do you stick with it What makes it worth enduring the quirks","83":"Hey Pixel fansIts been a few years since my last Pixel and almost 2 since my last Android phone but after todays event it feels like the right time to jump back in I currently have an iPhone 15 Pro Max Apple Watch Series 7 and some old AirPods I want to do the complete conversion and get the Pixel 9 Pro honestly might go with the Fold Pixel Watch 3 and the new Pixel buds Whats the most price effective way to go about doing so I can trade in my iPhone for 720 plus get that 300 store credit I have Google One for that extra 10 too Which would work fantastic towards the Pixel Watchbut it seems I need to receive the phone first before my store credit applies Also it also looks like I can get 150 store credit for my Apple Watch as a trade in towards the Pixel Watch I would use that for the Pixel Buds Is this the best route for me Is the Amazon or Best Buy deals betterI am locked to Verizon because of work if that mattersEdit Apologies in advance if this is an annoying question you all have to deal with every year","84":"","85":"Im a huge Google fan fully into the ecosystem owned a pixel 5 6 7 and now 8 I also have the same coveragereception issues people are reporting How do I know its not caused by anything else Because I also have an iPhone was a gift from last year Ive tested coverage with the same SIM card in the same locations and the pixel will just unfortunately not get any reception in some areas where the iPhone gets full bars Yes if I turn airplane mode on and off it will get refeption again for a few minutes but this cant be a permanent solutionsI absolutely love Google and want it to thrive be the best selling OEM out there Really hope these issues are addressed","86":"Ive been in the Google ecosystem for years now and have had Gioogle phones since they were called Nexus phones starting by the Galaxy Nexus then Nexus 4 and finally Nexus 6pMy current phone was a Google Pixel 7 and I absolutely loved it Two days ago I woke up to go the washroom and saw my phone notifying me that it would reboot soon to install Android 15 It was charging so I figured no problem do your thing I came back from the washroom to find the screen black but with a backlight still I thought it was rebooting so I waited The backlight eventually went away and that was it Since then Ive been unable to turn it on at all No recovery mode bootloader screen no adb devices nothing Its dead not a single light or sign of life when I charge it or plug it into a PCI took it to an authorized repair shop they opened the phone tried a new battery no luck Apparently the internals of the pixel are not modular at all Theres a battery module a camera module and everything else integrated into the motherboardIm devastated New Phone Money is not something that comes easy to me these days and this happening as part of an Android update pushed by google itself feels very wrong I contacted the support and was told that my phone was out of warranty I bought it in 2022 and that theres nothing they can do I found this response infuriating and unfair If a company is pushing OTA updates the least it can do is offer a store credit for when these updates brick someones phoneAnyhow I dont mean to spread fear and so far I was only able to find 3 other Pixel 77as that bricked during this update so its clearly not widespread enough for google to care I think","87":"Moderator power trip for those curioushttpsimgurcomaIWqzj12Those of you here who switched to iPhone that still browse this sub and even those of you who have recently switched from iPhone to Pixel or any other Android What are the pros and cons youve found What day to day part of the iPhone was better than on Android and vice versa What aspects of the ecosystem were good andor badId love to especially hear from people who are not otherwise entrenched in the Apple ecosystem If I were to switch wed still probably have chromebooks windows desktops linux laptops google speakers alexa speakers everything so I wouldnt necessarily benefit from Apples biggest strengthEDIT Holy bajeezus yall great Way more perspectives than I anticipated","88":"As the title states I just left the Apple world Now would be a good time to applaud me Ill wait Okay thanks Anyways I could not be happier with my new Google pixel 8a I have so much on my mind and I also have a little adhd so Ill try to stay on track First of all the reason that led me to switching is mainly my iPhone screen and back got severely cracked Especially the back and the camera lens area My daughter threw it a couple times out of frustration she struggles with sensory disorder so thats why shes a little aggressive and the back of my iPhone which is made out of flippin glass not to my surprise shattered Like of course it would bc its made of such a fragile material Yes I had a case on it Well honestly as soon as I saw how bad the damage was I already was drooling at the thought of leaving apple After all back in the day like 15 years ago my first phone was not an iPhone I was always an android girly I believe I got my first iPhone when I was in college I am 30 now and I did have an android cheapie phone 1 time between college and now for ahsort time but mostly it was apple and mostly i stayed with them bc all my family had apple and my husband too But secretly I always liked android way better So I talked to my husband and said look this is more expensive to repair than just buying a new android type phone they are not as expensive as apple He begrudgingly accepted my wish to purchase a new phone and I began my research Many videos and articles later I chose the Google Pixel 8a Everyone was saying its your best bang for your buck and theres not many differences between this cheaper model than the pro model more on that laterwould like to know your thoughts So I bought the phone I also decided to buy a Galaxy watch 6 to go with it as I need a watch I am used to using an appe watch daily I was gonna do the pixel watch but it looked like it was really lacking in features and it had not great reviews I would have loved to go with that so that it was seamless integration but oh well this GW6 works pretty near seamlessly I am thoroughly enjoying my new androidGoogle ecosystem of technology I really love it in fact which is why I am here I genuinely cant see myself ever going back Has anyone else here went from an iPhone to Google pixel Any any tips and tricks you want to share about my phone and also that GW6 would be awesome ","89":"I have an iPhone and I like it please dont downvote me but I want to hear other perspectives on why people choose the phones they do I have been interested in android for a while and would like to get one as my workschool phone What made you choose android as an operating system over iOS What are your favourite features that iOS doesnt have Why is the pixel your choice over a Samsung or other phone Whats your favourite part of the pixel What does the pixel do better than other phones Just want to hear other opinions and what makes this phone special for you guys Thank you so much and happy holidays ","90":"Ok Google you made this one rightAfter purchasing the iPhone 14 Pro Max I found myself feeling disappointed and unimpressed The iOS platform seemed stagnant and uninteresting to me and Apples reputation as a great software company fell shortAs I researched and watched more reviews of the Google Pixel 7 pro I was impressed by the advancements in technology and design since the Pixel line It was so tempting that I made the switch to the Pixel 7 pro one week ago and what can I say beside  I am absolutely blown away by its features the AIpowered features sleek user interface and seamless integration with Googles apps and services The screen is topnotch the camera is just gorgeous and the ecosystem is fantastic Iam completely in love with this phone and cant imagine going back THIS phone is why Android is now far away from its competitor Its just too good Thanks Google for creating such an impressive device","91":"I just gotta come here and express my gratitude towards Google for actually fixing and changing the many issues with their previous devices To preface Ive been a long time iPhone user who dabbles with the android ecosystem I used to flipflop back and forth each year between Apple and Google up until the Pixel 4 but then I felt like googles devices couldnt keep up with some of the hardware Apple uses on their devices Most recently I really tried to love the P8P but there was so many issues I couldnt see past that would degrade the experience of the device As with my job I cant really be near a charger at all times one of my main issues was the terrible battery life of the Pixel 8 Pro I wouldnt even make it through an 810 hour shift comfortably with the Pixel 8 Pro And it wasnt solely for screen on time but mainly standby time that was the culprit Of course screen time would degrade my battery life even quicker but as it was in my pocket for a few hours and Id go back onto my phone seeing that it lost 15 percent battery life was extremely unsettling Id constantly limit background usage turn 5G off an use LTE strictly turn off location services And although that helped slightly I dont believe you should limit your phone in a bunch of different ways to be able to prolong battery lifeI always also experienced laggingstuttering issues with the 8 Pro This issue is self explanatory and not much to say other than it seriously degraded the experience of using the phoneOverheating Yeah that was an issue constantly Id be using maps on my car and my phone would have an overheating warning In direct sunlight Id have an overheating warning Etc it was just a constant battle The modem on the 8 Pro was AWFUL Such spotty service dropped calls and again limiting to LTE instead of 5G just to have improvements on the battery life Now with the P9PXL oh my what a drastic difference And of course this is my experience with the device but battery has been amazing The standby times have been excellent no need to limit background usage limit to LTE turn down screen resolution Yesterday I had over 4 hours SOT and the device was still at 50 ish percent battery life by the time I got home I was using the camera maps daily texting phone calls emails social media and this device just handled it so well The modem is crazy good Id argue better than apples I live in the basement of my house and on either the 8 Pro or 15 Pro Max Id get one bar or no bars in my room P9PXL is sitting at 3 bars right now in a room I struggled to have service in Havent experienced a single dropped call using 5G and this modem is killing it allOverheating hasnt been an issue at all This phone remains cool with my usage patterns because of that new vapor chamber Havent had a single overheating issue whether using android auto or just being outside on my deviceStuttering hasnt been an issue at all The UI has been buttery smooth No hiccups or stuttering The new fingerprint sensor works flawlessly Im using a tempered glass screen protector and it just reads my fingerprint without delay Messing around with the add me feature on the camera and the magic eraser its just crazy what AI on a device can do Some of the features are a gimmick in my opinion but some of these features are seriously QOL features With RCS finally available on iPhone well currently to those who have the iOS 18 beta texting between iPhone and Android has been lovely with those read receipts reply features no horribly compressed photosvideos I say this with full confidence but I genuinely feel like this is finally a Pixel year for me Im seriously loving everything about this phone ","92":"It just doesnt seem like Google focuses much on the Google Pixel Tablet and if you look it up online you really dont find much information on it or many people talking about it Ive been using it for a few months now and while its not the fastest Tablet its still really nice in my opinion especially since its Stock Android its basically just like a larger Google Pixel Phone which is really cool and I think its a great addon to my Google Ecosystem I just wish Google gave it more attention and longer Update support Yes I know they might be coming out with a Google Pixel Tablet 2 but I still think this Tablet deserves more attention and longer Update support Thoughts","93":"I love a lot of things about the pixel but as a long time iOS user Im having mild buyers remorse  anxiety I have 8 days left to trade the phone back  Would love some reassurance from longerterm pixel users I will say some stuff I love so far is  Design the Hazel is stellar  Google makes everything easy its well explained and covers most of the bases youd have questions around from switching over  Google ecosystem works great for productivity  Pictures are fun to take and the quality is imo better for the casual enjoyer Customization but wont get into it as everyone knows this already  Google is putting in effort to be consumer friendly while apple recently has been trending opposite Cost to package ratio Some stuff Im having anxiety about  accessories are what I miss most about apple Really liked my Apple watch and airpods I have pixel buds now and they just dont hit how I hoped  unfortunately Im one of the users affected by scroll stutter and lag in many apps like Reddit FB YouTube and instagram makes me feel like the phone is less premium On android 15 Google photos just isnt as seamless as iCloud photos imo it syncs inconsistently for me switching between cameras is VERY choppy  app performance I feel as if the QAQC of 3rd party apps is not up to par with apple the difference between optimization of different apps is noticeable whereas on iOS they are all generally similar to where you dont feel much of a difference ","94":"I am flabbergasted this is a flagship phone There has been zero progress in the 12 years since I last owned one why is the camera glitching every time I zoom in or focus on something within a foot Same with video why is the keyboard utter shite Like its terrible so many characters are hidden two screens away why do I have to face unlock my wallet the face unlock to switch cards a second later why does the highlight word for copypaste sometimes never work Sometimes given random options Why can I not move the cursor with a tap the autocorrect is utterly baffling I will get one character wrong and it wont suggest the word why when sharing a photo is the next and confirm button on two separate areas of the screen zero flow for a user seriously poor UI why does the calendar open on the last day you checked in the past Not on today the calendar is stupid trying to set a reminder so youre reminded for an appointment is wildly complicated adding a favourite to contacts is also weird why make me add them either as a message favourite a call favourite or a WhatsApp favourite Just add the person wireless charging always overheats apps crashing have IG WA all crashSorry but Apple fans are clearly suffering from Stockholm Syndrome just putting up with this craprant over ","95":"So Ive been working on this for a few months and posted it a couple of times and got some helpful feedback and I think its finally ready to share This will be mostly an Apple vs Pixel comparison but for the most part goes for all Android phones For context I went from Pixel 4a  iPhone 13 Pro  Pixel 5 I used the iPhone for 5 months before throwing in the towel These are obviously not all of the differences but these are the ones that I found most impactful on my personal experienceIn order from most impactful to least Pros iOS is just way faster and more reliable Apps work so much better and faster on iOS and contain additional features that are simply missing from their Android counterparts Memory management is better apps seem to never ever have to relaunch Apple does more with less software is better optimized to make the most of the hardware It really does seem to just work for the most part What it does do it does consistently well and things behave the way you expect them to I havent encountered a single bug By far and away the biggest pro Definitely other people I know have experienced bugs but most people seem to agree with this on the whole My Pixel 4a had a number of issues The most significant of which was a proximity sensor issue presumably that would turn off the screen when I had an incoming call making it unable to answer and making me unable to access the buttons in the middle of a call And the fingerprint sensor did not work I had it replaced and it worked again for a few weeks and then stopped working again WiFi calling does not work on my Pixel 5 just silence and I had to disable the DNS because it was causing me to lose service altogether mobile and WiFi multiple timesday until I restarted it which was also really fun to diagnose iMessage Really only a benefit because other people I message have iPhones Android has an equivalent product but like many of their equivalent products they have failed to proliferate Perhaps a downside to the customization of Android is carriersOEMs fight over standardization which means nobody uses any of them Its fine but thanks to Apple it only works on Apple devices Support if you need help with an issue unless you pay extra for AppleCare Apple will direct you to their mostly useless online selfhelp resources but worstcase scenario you can just walk into an Apple store assuming you have one nearby and they wont  turn you away When I was looking for a new phone it felt like there were no Android OEMs that wanted to sell me a phone When I walked into the Apple store this is what ultimately sold me Their reps are super nice and eager to help Google has Preferred Care via uBreakiFix but its really not the same experience and there are no Google Stores to my knowledge Video quality is drastically better than anything available on Android thanks to the optics and A15 chip I dont think anyone will argue against that However its worth noting that the vast majority of the time when you share those videos the quality is just murdered to the point that it really doesnt matter Ecosystem If you DO have ALL Apple products they work together exceptionally well Android has some stopgap solutions with Windows but unless youre using a Chromebook which comes with its own compromises there is no powerful and versatile desktoplaptop solution There is no good tablet or watch currently There are options on the horizon but theyve tried this before and failed Connectivity I seemed to always have service interruptions and weird quirks and bugs with every Android phone The iPhone was exceptional in that regard and I had service in many places I did not with other phones Battery life Its a longboi Apples vertical integration allows for super powerful but also high efficiency hardware The battery will easily last me a couple of days Haptic Feedback yes its as good as everyone says its almost like a whole language and the ability to customize your own haptic feedback is pretty awesome Shortcuts I didnt really get around to using these but it is quite a neat feature but not super userfriendly The fact that theres a sort of store where you can simply install them is supercool and makes them more userfriendly Its pretty annoying that a notification pops up each time a Shortcut is run Android has some similar but inferior apps like Macrodroid and IFTTT but nothing baked into the OS Google has routines via Assistant but theyre incredibly limited in what they can do iPhones have 5 years of software support The latest Pixels get at least 3 years for OS updates and 5 years for security updates that may include feature drops Most Android phones are lucky to get 2 but Pixels have a good track record Hold that thought though until we get to the consCons Spam handling As someone who receives about 45 annoying spam textscalls per day they just make me miserable Firstly and Im not sure if this is particular to the Pixel or just the Google phone app but Google runs any incoming calls against their Google Maps database so it gives you a sort of quasicallerID whatever happened to caller ID anyway Secondly the Pixel has the Call Screen feature and a robust SMS spam filtering service not to mention Hold For Me and Direct My Call that works really well There are very few things I consider invaluable in a smartphone but Call Screen is one of them Theres nothing more satisfying than looking down at a silent notification and seeing that some spammer or robocall was screened and declined You dont even realize how well the SMS filter works until you go into the spam folder and look at all the messages it filteredor buy an iPhone iMessage hasalmost nothing You can filter unknown senderscallers and you can bring in other 3rd party callmessage filtering apps but they dont seem to work well and are typically a paid service When searching through Apple support they just direct you to talk to your carrier Blocking callers is like a 12step process and theres not even a way to mark them as junk This was the last straw for me and why I eventually threw in the towel I had a particularly bad day for spam Like 10 callstexts in the span of a few hours Huge 1 con for sure but thats just me Notification handling and customization On Android notifications are automatically sorted and grouped according to importance Some can be silenced The iOS notification pane again relies on the furthest possible corner of the phone if youre righthanded Persistent notifications are nonexistent and I find this means my notifications are regularly missed or forgotten about After a while I realized there are lock screen notifications and then there are MORE OTHER NOTIFICATIONS when you pull down the notification shade FUCKING WHY The swipe gestures are difficult to use Many times I try to do a horizontal halfswipe or whatever to get to the options menu to change notification settings but then swipe a little too far and it disappears from existence Theres no way to access notification history like you can very easily and intuitively on Android so theyre just gone forever Ive noticed many people pay no attention to their notifications as they have a thousand of them but I manage them very closely on Android to ensure the important stuff was prioritized The notifications on iOS dont disappear when I read them on another device specifically Gmail like they do on Android Keyboard The fact that after all these years Apple still does such a bad job with something so simple and something you interact with every time you pick up the device is nothing short of astonishing The Apple keyboard has a mindbendingly stupid buttonaccessed second layer for all punctuation and numericals GBoard on Android allows you to add a second longpress layer add a number row and resize the keyboard to maximize screen real estate Swipe typing on iOS justdoesnt seem to work very well at all Swipe typing on Android makes onehanded typing very easy I can even do it without looking The Android keyboard also has a dedicated button to dock it where on iOS I have a hard time figuring out how to put it away SOMETIMES you can swipe down and it disappears but other times it doesnt and its just very confusing and inconsistent The audible feedback on iOS is just this loud almost earshattering clack GBoard has a nice sound like rubbing your finger on a piece of paper It also has different sounds for the space and backspace buttons that legitimately make it easier to type faster and more accurately 3rd party keyboards make typing a little better but still much worse than GBoard Antirighttorepair stance Does it really do any good to have 5 years of software support if they dont support the hardware Apple is an industryleader in preventing repairs of their own devices and irreparable construction methods They go to great lengths to ensure this going so far as to serialize virtually every part like camera modules so they wont work even if you swap them from one iPhone to another They have also sent ICE to raid small businesses who are using OEM parts sold illegally from Chinese distributors and sent out cease and desist letters and threatened lawsuits The agreements with Apples vendors preclude them from selling any of their own parts to anyone but Apple That means if you have a broken 5 microchip you cant easily get it repaired anywhere and Apple will tell you you need to replace the entire device at a price that is not at all costeffective in an effort to get you to trash it and buy a new one Although they do provide costeffective solutions for common replacements like screens and batteries Custom notification sounds This is a huge one for me because I can tell the priority level of any notification without pulling the phone out of my pocket and whether or not I need to readrespond This helps tremendously for me to maintain focus on what Im doing Not possible on most iOS apps No universal back gesture This is something I used on Android every time I picked up the phone Its very intuitive and natural if you want to go back you just swipe from the edge of the screen iOS doesnt seem to have any sort of universal back function at all Sometimes you can swipe from the left of the screen to the right but it is inconsistent as to when you can do this Also even when it does work swiping left to right is not the easiest thing to do righthanded The Android gesture is ambidextrous Desktop messaging More walled garden problems In order to use a desktop client you must have an Apple computer On Android you can use whatever you want its just done through the browser So Im forced to type on and read from my tiny little phone screen when Im at home on that miserable little keyboard instead of my 49 desktop monitor and fullsize physical keyboard Text selection It boggles my mind that something so simple can be implemented so poorly and for so long I still dont understand how its supposed to work because it seems to do something different every time Longpressing on the screen brings up a magnified view which is promptly hidden by the finger youre using to select when moving up Moving this magnified view updown on the screen and enlarging it seems like a super obvious and simple fix to this issue It could even be tailored to right and lefthanded users but that type of customization is atypical of Apple You can also longpress on the space bar but the thing moves so damn fast that its incredibly difficult to get the cursor where you want it It seems the obvious and simple fix is just to slow it down I can send fucking memojis and Venmo payments but contacts cannot be sent from within iMessage I used this daily in Google Messages instead of typing out my name and title Instead I have to send through the contacts app which makes it not even worth the effort I just end up typing in my information on that miserable little keyboard I suspect this is another walled garden thing because it will send it automatically through iMessage if you opt into it Weight I guess some people equate a heavy phone with premium build quality Im of the opposite opinion Pixel 5 is 151g vs iPhone 13P 204g 35 lighter Keep in mind both of these devices are very close in external dimensions Most of this weight savings is derived from the more durable aluminum frame construction vs heavier more fragile premium glass No plugins for Firefox ad blockers dark mode etc All browsers are modified versions of Safari Face ID Face ID means you have a notch in the top of your screen which takes up the space used by persistent notifications in Android This is not an issue specifically with Apples implementation of Face ID but just the concept of Face ID in general If you ask me FaceID offers no benefits to account for this and they figured out biometric verification with the iPhone 5s fingerprint sensor Shortly after that many Android OEMs moved the sensor to the back of the phone to free up screen real estate its also just a more convenient location Anything and everything after that has just been an attempt at perceived progress while actually being the opposite in my opinion Default SMS If for example you wanted to use Signal on Android you can set it as the default messenger and it will just default to SMS if the person youre messaging is not using Signal Not possible on iOS Stupid fucking lightning cables Absolutely no reason for these things to have them but you have to spend another 100 on a whole set of new cables you have to carry around in addition to USBC cables for other devices for absolutely no reason Aesthetics Pixels and Google in general just feel very fun Very colorful and the Pixel UI reflects that with beautiful preloaded wallpapers that regularly rotate themselves out by default and Material You that gives you lots of fun colors and just generally being really nice to look at iOS on the contrary is fairly boring to look at and does not change on a regular basis much less in the last 5 years Slow charging 75W wireless 20W wired Bit of a nitpick here since theyre more efficient and have smaller batteries but many Android flagships are running 45200W charging My Pixel 5 is only 18W wired but 12W wireless with compatible charger obviously Not a huge issue either way for me personally as Im never far from a charger for very long Siri vs Google Assistant Google Assistant is still just so so much better Cost the iPhone 13 Pro I bought was 1k The Pixel 4a I had previously which is in my opinion superior was 350Conclusion The iPhone works better but the PixelAndroid does more I think thats the most succinct way I can put itApple really nails the difficult stuff like reliability efficiency ecosystem and speed but just flops on the easy stuff which is such a shame It would be very easy for them to make the iPhone 1000 better I will deal with the occasional bugs to achieve greater functionality"}}
