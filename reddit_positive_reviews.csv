"Positive","Pixel 9 Pro XL is Amazing.I just gotta come here and express my gratitude towards Google for actually fixing and changing the many issues with their previous devices To preface Ive been a long time iPhone user who dabbles with the android ecosystem I used to flipflop back and forth each year between Apple and Google up until the Pixel 4 but then I felt like googles devices couldnt keep up with some of the hardware Apple uses on their devices Most recently I really tried to love the P8P but there was so many issues I couldnt see past that would degrade the experience of the device As with my job I cant really be near a charger at all times one of my main issues was the terrible battery life of the Pixel 8 Pro I wouldnt even make it through an 810 hour shift comfortably with the Pixel 8 Pro And it wasnt solely for screen on time but mainly standby time that was the culprit Of course screen time would degrade my battery life even quicker but as it was in my pocket for a few hours and Id go back onto my phone seeing that it lost 15 percent battery life was extremely unsettling Id constantly limit background usage turn 5G off an use LTE strictly turn off location services And although that helped slightly I dont believe you should limit your phone in a bunch of different ways to be able to prolong battery lifeI always also experienced laggingstuttering issues with the 8 Pro This issue is self explanatory and not much to say other than it seriously degraded the experience of using the phoneOverheating Yeah that was an issue constantly Id be using maps on my car and my phone would have an overheating warning In direct sunlight Id have an overheating warning Etc it was just a constant battle The modem on the 8 Pro was AWFUL Such spotty service dropped calls and again limiting to LTE instead of 5G just to have improvements on the battery life Now with the P9PXL oh my what a drastic difference And of course this is my experience with the device but battery has been amazing The standby times have been excellent no need to limit background usage limit to LTE turn down screen resolution Yesterday I had over 4 hours SOT and the device was still at 50 ish percent battery life by the time I got home I was using the camera maps daily texting phone calls emails social media and this device just handled it so well The modem is crazy good Id argue better than apples I live in the basement of my house and on either the 8 Pro or 15 Pro Max Id get one bar or no bars in my room P9PXL is sitting at 3 bars right now in a room I struggled to have service in Havent experienced a single dropped call using 5G and this modem is killing it allOverheating hasnt been an issue at all This phone remains cool with my usage patterns because of that new vapor chamber Havent had a single overheating issue whether using android auto or just being outside on my deviceStuttering hasnt been an issue at all The UI has been buttery smooth No hiccups or stuttering The new fingerprint sensor works flawlessly Im using a tempered glass screen protector and it just reads my fingerprint without delay Messing around with the add me feature on the camera and the magic eraser its just crazy what AI on a device can do Some of the features are a gimmick in my opinion but some of these features are seriously QOL features With RCS finally available on iPhone well currently to those who have the iOS 18 beta texting between iPhone and Android has been lovely with those read receipts reply features no horribly compressed photosvideos I say this with full confidence but I genuinely feel like this is finally a Pixel year for me Im seriously loving everything about this phone ","2024-08-28 14:58:00"

"Positive","iOS vs Android Pixel comparison Part 1 Why Pixel Outshines iPhone.As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel Ive noticed several areas where Pixel excels Heres my breakdown  Edit Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom due to community rules 1 Advanced Notification System Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and current playback in the notification center notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful Intuitive notification management eg disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app  2 Clear Interactive System Information Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone Alarm volume feedback when you miss an alarm it shows you that volume of your alarm is low Reminder to close Incognito pages after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on  3 Robust File Management PClike file system with enhanced filtering All your documents from whatever app you use you will find it in the documents tap Same for images Its universal same as the PC Because files controls all Its better cleaning of cluttering files  4 Enhanced User Interface Google search bar on home screen and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS Maybe because its older feature so Its much adopted You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and Im addicted to it right now Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for nonnative English speakers  5 Multimedia and Connectivity More practical PictureinPicture PiP functionality Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay especially for web pages and not so popular website Specially in background continuity of the casting You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet  6 Communication Features Full call history logs Easy one here iPhone   7 Customization and Productivity Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature Specially you can pin you copies for ever The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it In this way you will have bigger windows but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as its on chrome browser on windows Its fast accurate and never disappoint you Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons  8 App Availability I dont why but Android in general have collection of not wellknown apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use For example in Android in IPTV 9stream You cannot find similar app on iPhone Downloading apps from outside the Play store gives you the freedom you have on windows  9 Device Analysis Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights Part 2 why iOS in some parts outperform Android PixelNow the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel 1 Better Face UnlockiOSs Face ID is still the best in class Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure For example it cannot verify your wallet payment 2 Unified Call HistoryHaving all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important I know some users hate this feature but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work 3 Spotlight SearchSpotlight search is the Feature No 1 that I wish android has One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device even files documents photos For example if you swipe down and type passport iOS will give you the passport document in Files app in addition to the Passport screenshots photos in your Photos app 4 Text Cursor ControlHold space to move the cursor making text editing easier Better than the one in Gboard 5 Privacy in TrackingBetter control and transparency over app tracking 6 VPN in SafariBuiltin VPN support while Google Ones VPN isnt available in my country 7BestinClass AccessoriesAir Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone  For example If I wear the AirPods while Im watching Youtube in the Apple TV notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone neat featureAlso you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone 8 Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes

"Positive","Why im saying goodbye to Pixel after almost 10 years  .Hey Pixel ownersJust wanted to share my experience using Google phones for a decade and also why i decided to give another brand a try for now TLDR I feel like ive been a beta tester for google since the Pixel 6 and upwardsIve been using google phones since the Nexus 6P and instantly fell in love with them The camera of the 6P was ahead of its time especially the ease of use My previous phones were Galaxies and these camera apps always had me take 4 or 5 pics before i snapped the right shot the 6P just made it into a one hit wonder I also loved the clean Android feel and seeing Android be improved to what it is today was an amazing journey Google phones i owned Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel 2 XL the panda 3 Pixel 3 Pixel 4 Pixel 3 again I loved the size Pixel 6  Pixel 8 and pixel watch  budsMy experience with Pixel phones has been outstanding especially in the beginning I was a BIG advocate of using Pixels and shilled them a lot They were a bit hard to come by in Holland at first so id import them Such great phones though I bought a Pixel 4 for my Mom that still works to this day No lag just smooth as butter I also loved the google ecosystem and the design language I still do I think android has really matured and is in so many ways pushing the envelope in smartphone OS development Im trying a different brand now but i do miss a lot of the features that android offers Its so smooth and navigating the phone is superb Universal back gesture now playing flip to DnD flick your wrist to reverse to selfie cam So many nifty ways to interact with your phone i love itThere has been a but in this story for me unfortunately Ever since the Pixel 6 the road has gotten a bit bumpy for me The 6 had strange issues would have excessive battery drain get really hot and have software bugs like apps hanging I loved these phones for the stability and this was getting a bit of an issue Maybe i was just unluckyI hoped it was a 6 issue so i upgraded to the regular 8  pixel watch 2 and this is were it really got crappy for me on the hardware spectrum The 8 had a few software issues like apps hanging when multitasking that i could live with but the hardware started failing me while traveling Japan First my Pixel Watch 2 just stopped charging and died on me out of the blue and a month later my Pixel 8 started getting a weird green screen issue tens of times a day the screen would just turn green and spaz out for a minute Very inconvenient when youre on a Japanese train station trying to figure out where to go Combine that with google maps hanging a lot when in PIP mode and it was beginning to become an annoyance to use the P8 on the roadGoogle supports solution was for them to send the phone in for repair which would mean i would be without a phone for 23 weeks so i was forced to buy a phone in Japan to travel without hassle I realised i kinda lost faith in the stability of my pixel because of my 6 and 8 experience so i decided to switch sides And i feel a bit sad to leave the Pixels behind to be honest I genuinely love these phones ive captured many great memories with em and theyve accompanied me on so many great adventures and never let me down Until recentlyNow having joined the other side still feels weird Its a gorgeous device to look at but i dont think the other brand has a better operating system and in lots of ways i miss my pixels ease of use Switching was not that difficult so i will definitely be back in the future but i really want Google to deliver a more stable hardware experience firstI feel like ive been a beta tester with these last 2 Pixels To get a support solution that involves not having my phone for 2 weeks is also very unsatisfactory And strange as my watch WAS able to be exchanged  but the watch is not really something i cant travel withoutI feel like with googles ambitions being upscaled theyre also upscaling some of the woes these phones have and its reflecting on the quality of my experiences I really hope the 9 will be a succes and makes me wanna jump back into the Pixel experience but i think im gonna skip a few generations Itll be good to fall in love with em again Anyway first world problems eh","2024-06-19 03:27:22"
"Positive","Pixel Buds Pro 2 Unbiased review from someone whos used many earbuds.So Ive been using the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for a day now and Im pretty happy with them overall Heres the breakdown  Comfort  Fit These things are TINY  Way smaller than the first gen and they feel great in my ears Havent had any issues with them falling out even during runs  Sound Quality The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro  Its clear and balanced and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds Ive been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles wont like these but I disagree The profile is flat and natural Things sound how theyre supposed to sound like a mostly true studio quality You can turn the bass up if you need more  ANC Noise cancellation is solid Its on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds my previous daily driver and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear  Transparency Mode  This is where they really shine Transparency mode is fantastic  it feels super natural almost like youre not wearing earbuds at all This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many Ive tried these are hands down the best  Multipoint Works seamlessly  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues  Case The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original which is a nice touch The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case  Mics Mic quality is very clear  Touch controls Basically no difference here Ive never had issues with the touch controls on previous generationsOverallThe Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original Theyre comfortable sound great and have excellent transparency mode  If youre looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone these are a great optionLet me know if you have any questions","2024-09-27 01:05:18"

"Positive","Moving between iPhone and Pixel 9 Pro XL  observations after one month.LONG POSTI know there have been loads of posts asking this question so I thought I would let you know my experiences of running a Pixel 9 Pro XL and iPhone 15 Pro Max in tandem for a month and what I have noticedPlease note these are just my opinions and observations some may be wrong and I just havent discovered ways of doing things yet  I also ran an Apple Watch Ultra and Pixel Watch 3 since release day too so will mention those at the endTLDR   Both phones have plusses and minuses and both are excellent you wont be disappointed with either Watches AW Ultra has a better battery and is tougher but more expensive than the PW3 but the PW3 seems better at tracking sleep and fitness for me see comment about HR readings on UltraiPhone iOS18 observationsTap top of screen to scroll up is a feature I really miss on the Pixel  Its so useful note I am aware of the android app that does this but its flaky and crapPlaying music hands free using Siri  if Im cooking I can tell Siri to play music and it does it  Pixel Gemini wont as it says it needs to be unlocked first Very irritating  There is a workaround for this which is to use your Pixel Watch if you have one as an extended unlock item and use your home address as extended unlock but there shouldnt need to beAdd reminders handsfree using Siri  same as above  I can tell Siri to add a reminder about something and it does it every time pretty much perfectly  Pixel again asks to be unlocked firstAdd locationbased reminders hands free using Siri  can ask Siri to remind me to do something when I get home  I have no idea what Gemini is doing here  Most of the time it just says it cant do that but occasionally it says it has done it but nothing happens  And very occasionally it adds a Google keep reminder that doesnt announce itself but is there  This is my biggest bugbear with GeminiCustomising lock screen better on my iPhone in my opinion  I love swiping for different colours looks and backgrounds interfacing with my photos and stuff  And I LOVE the multicoloured timeUsing collections of images as lock screen pictures  this is such a brilliant feature I was astonished to find Google no longer do this  I can make a folder of family photos and have them swap on my lock screen Why cant Pixel again yes Im aware there is software for this but I havent managed to find one thats free that works the same without ads or isnt flaky etcInteraction generally between calendar reminders and Siri is just more flexible and powerful than on the Pixel  Every option I need is on there  Location based reminders repeating adding locations with a link to Maps everything  Pixels is a bit of a mess and tasks is so limited BafflingBouncing animated photos  where you can get a topshot image eg short video and select it to bounce back and forth This can produce some really cool effects and looks good in the photos app  Not possible on PixelCopy and paste from phone to MacBookiPad and viceversa  This is such a handy feature and I use it all the time  Obviously Pixel is unable to do thisAirPlay to my Sonos speakers in Apple Music Yes Im a weirdo and use AM not Spotify  I love being able to cast to speakers through AM not the Sonos app Yes I know Spotify can cast to any Sonos speakers though which AM cant natively so this is a bonus for PixelThe Journal app  I actually use this and there is no equivalent Pixel app as default happy to hear peoples recommendations here for one which works with iOSAndroidWiFi QR codesshare WiFi password  this is new in iOS18 and is really handy as it works cross platform As far as I know it isnt on PixelSafari reading mode  I hate adverts I mean I really really HATE modern advertising  So I use this feature all the time  Pixel does not have it But actually Pixel has a better solution to this with an app from Google  See my comments on my Pixel listRemoving annoying ads in Safari  another iOS18 feature God I love this Just delete all those shitty irritating adverts and read in peace Works in MacOS tooMeasurements tool  I use this quite a lot in my job and its great  I work in Health and Safety and often need to measure room sizes  The measure tool works really well Image crop to screen size  another small but neat feature  If you zoom in on an image to fill the screen a box comes up asking you if you want to crop the image to make a perfect wallpaper sized imageSwipe down to search is much much more comprehensive than Swipe up to search in Pixel I use this feature a lot and its great  In fact I use this to do almost everything  You can search for videos photos by person or by subject eg dog beach York Minster etc music emails images apps news stories anything  Its brilliant  The Pixel one is just really really limitedKeyboard space bar moved cursor in any direction on the Apple keyboard the Google one only moves left and right This is tedious and annoying when the spelling or change is at the start of the message and fruitlessly tapping close to it is annoying  Apples solution is just better hereNote on keyboards I have come to realise that I used to endlessly moan about the Apple keyboard and how annoying it was but the Pixel one is as bad for me so it must be down to my swiping inaccuracy in the main There is no noticeable difference for me between themNight view mode in landscape at night is great and works really well as a bedside clock  And a wave of the hand brings up the time in red at night if you wake up  Really nice featureCalendar entries If you ask Siri to tell you your calendar entries it will tell you all of them including shared calendar entries Gemini can only tell you Google calendar entries  Siri is pretty shitty generally but this is one area it really nailsApple Pay is less faffy and seems far more reliable than Google Pay for me so far I seem to keep having to unlock my Google Pay and reswiping every time  And if I have a store card it just gets completely confused  And I often have to fish around to get the machine to read my phone  Apple Pay just works logically and perfectly every single timeApple fitness on the watch works really well with synchronising exercise and videos together setting reminders to work out and so on  Just really well thought outScreen attention and by extension face unlock is much better on the iPhone Pixel locks the screen if I am wearing my reading glasses or in a dark room sometimesNow for my Pixel observationsNote these are for Google Pixel Pro 9 XL and Android 14Now playing on the lock screen is brilliant for a music fan like me Just love love love this featureNow Playing list saving all music it has heard and having a shortcut on the home screen  So I dont even need to pay attention now I can take a look later at what the song was  Such a cool featureWatch later for YouTube suggestions previews in Netflix accessed directly from notifications  This is brilliant and so much easier than ApplesNotifications are a bit better generally but I  particularly love YouTube suggestions that I can cast to my TV by a single tap from the notification or adding something to a watch list suggestion from Three BBC etcReplying directly to messages from the notifications is great too  Apple just doesnt do thisCast to my Sonos speakers in Spotify I dont use it but my daughter does and its really cool to cast in the Spotify app to any Sonos speakers iPhone can only cast to some of my Sonos speakers not all of themGemini generally better than Siri by a mile except having to unlock phone nonsense and points mentioned above regarding calendar and location based reminders etc Its such a shame it isnt all integrated properly because it frankly makes Siri look embarrassing for most stuff  Night and day better for asking about events places facts news stories pretty much anything Siris Ive found this on the web is embarrassing and its not going to be until at least first Quarter 2025 before it improvesPixel screenshots is really handy too just started using this and find it useful  Its great you can create reminders from it as well but why does it not back it all up  AnnoyingNight Sight camera is amazing  Four minute long exposure images very coolNot sure whether I prefer Google Photos or Apple for memories editing and so on  They are pretty closely matched for me Not sure I like the iOS18 photos app yet to be honest so Google Photos probably gets the nod here at the moment but its very close  Both are some of the best software that Google and Apple have to offerGemini live isnt there yet  The DEI and  preaching crap it keeps bringing up is really annoying I dont need my phone to remind me that all people are equal or women should be respected every time I ask for a fact about employment figures thanks Google  It also needs to be able to talk to normal Gemini to create links show photos play music and so on And do it when the phone is still locked GoogleCall screening  I havent used it yet but presuming it works its a great featureThe reading mode in Safari is something I mentioned that I love for the iPhone  Google has a free download called Reader mode and you can set it up to activate using a two finger swipe up from bottom of screen  this is actually better than iOS in some ways because it works in the news reader and loads of other apps too It doesnt include images though which the Apple Safari one does This doesnt come preinstalled thoughRecorder app with summary and text translation is a great featureSplit screen although it is a bit flaky on Android 14  Reddit always crashes using it for example  Maybe they will fix it for Android 15 or remove itHold for me Amazing if it works again I havent used it yet thoughDirect my call as aboveNotification history is a nice touch  being able to look back at all my notifications if I accidentally deleted one NiceGemini feature ask about this screen  option appears if this is available on the screen and you can ask questions about it Works quite wellSelecting text via the app switcher is niceGoogle news  you can block any providers you dont like completely Apple news leaves a big sign there saying you have blocked this news provider  click here to unblock which is a big screw you from Apple as far as I can seeGoogle lens although this is coming in iOS is quite cool tooMagic eraser is really good for removing things from photos works far better than I thought possible Again it is coming to iOS in the coming months  I used the beta though and it was poorNow a couple of observations about smart watchesApple watch Ultra has better battery life but the PW3 will still happily get you through 24 hours including sleep tracking working out and listening to musicSleep tracking seems more accurate on my Pixel Watch 3 my AW seems to badly underestimate deep sleepExercise stuff seems pretty similar although I should note that on my Ultra my HR monitor always disconnects corrupting my data  Very annoying  Note that all my normal AW did not do this and were fineIt is much easier and better to get new watch faces on the Pixel Watch On AW this is really flaky and annoying if you arent using the standard facesUltra is far tougher than the pixel Watch Im still nervous about scratching my PW3I personally prefer the strap system of the Apple watch Still waiting for my pixel buds pro 2s so no comparison there yetWell I hope anybody looking to move between Pixel and Apple finds some of this useful  Im sure I will get plenty of posts with solutions for Pixel that are like iPhone features If so thanks  And remember these are just my observations and opinions","2024-09-25 08:14:30"

"Positive","Pixel Buds Pro 2 v Airpods Pro 2 an amateur review for those interested in reading this.After switching fully from an iPhone 12 to a Pixel 9 I leaned in hard on the switch and got the Pixel Buds Pro 2 The quality of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in both sound and usability is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the Airpod Pros 2 Im no tech guru but as an average consumer who listens to music while doing admin work in the office or while running outdoors the sound quality on these things Pixel Buds Pro 2 is magnificent The bass quality had me dancing almost right away And the noise cancellation works SO wellAs far as usability is concerned it always drove me nuts on the Airpod Pros 2 whenever Id need to switch songs while I was out for a run I hated having to squeeze both sides of an airpod multiple times just to change a song go back or pause Perhaps its just me or the shape of my ears but whenever I would squeeze the airpod Id have to quickly readjust the airpod in my ear The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are so simple to use a quick tap on the outside of the bud does the job Accessing Google Assistant or enabling Noise Cancellation feels so easy to doAlso I love that there are color variations to choose from on the Pixel buds This may not be important for everyone but it is to meIt was worth every penny switching over to the Pixel Buds Pro 2 from the Airpod Pros 2 If both the Pixel Buds and Airpods worked well on iPhones Id still always choose the Pixel Buds not that I ever plan to go back to an iPhone after the P9 I hope you liked my review Have a great day","2024-10-03 15:21:59"

"Positive","Pixel Buds 2 Pro Eary impressions  comparison with Sony WF1000XM4.I preordered my Buds 2 Pro on Sept 1 and they arrived today Sydney Australia Early impressions and comparions with Sony WF1000XM4 below Note that I bought then immediately sent back the original Pixel Buds Pro when they were first released in favour of keeping the XM4s As others have said theyre very small and light Fit feels good Im not sure I have the right sized tips in yet Im just using the mediums so far but they definitely feel secure They dont move at all when I shake my head around The real test though is sweat Ill wear them on my walk tomorrow hopefully to test if the seal breaks continually Thats the usual problem I have with buds I pretty much solved it with Comply tips on the XM4s Oh and I tested eating with them in and they didnt move YMMV but great for me I could sleep in these but I have pretty big ears so they dont stick out on me  Slept in them last night All playback controls work every time play pause skip etc I REALLY like that the confirmation beep on skip track is slightly delayed On the XM4s its immediate and I often dont hear it because all I can hear is my tap This is compounded by the fact that the XM4s controls are much harder to hit cleanly so I often end up pausing single tap when Im trying to skip double tap Volume swipe works every time Tap and hold for assistant works every time Assistant is fast and helpful I believe its using my phones chosen assistant I prefer Google Assistant to Gemini still Slight issue the assistants voice MAY be a little too loud for my liking I havent tried reducing it yet and Im not sure I want to because itll probably be a good volume when Im most likely to use it while walking Sound quality is very good Hard to say if its better than the XM4s because I have both EQd But I like the PBP2 setup better than the setup Ive got going on the XM4 at the moment Its all a lot cleaner but still very prominent and clean bass The XM4s sound muddy by comparison I may be able to close that gap by adjusting my EQ but havent tried yet and probably wont Theyre not a patch on my 50 IEMs for sound quality but thats to be expected Eartip seal check didnt work Said there was too much noise even though I was sitting completely still in a quiet room Hearing wellness feature is cool I often worry I have the volume too high but it says Im OK  Thats at about 80dB Conversation detection isnt working out of the box Ive looked hard and theres no setting for it I Googled it and can see that other people have experienced this problem One guy said it magically appeared after a few hours so Ill keep checking back Apparently my firmware is up to date so Ill just have to wait  Yep the toggle setting just appeared after a few hours Weird And yep its good Kicks in in about 12 seconds Love the case Its better than the Pixel Buds A case and definitely better than the XM4 case With the XM4s I always seem to choose the wrong side to open the lid from It seems like a trivial thing I know but still Putting in and out of the case is easier than with the original Pixel Buds Pro Not yet easier than the XM4s but I suspect thats just a question of getting used to it  muscle memoryI cant think of anything else to mention but if you have any questions feel free to ask If I think of anything else later Ill edit my original postEDIT I believe ANC is significantly better than the original Buds Pro from memory They were nowhere near as good as the XM4s The Buds Pro 2 are actually better than the XM4s However its important to note that I have different tips on the XM4s now Back when I compared them to the original Pixel Buds Pro I was using the stock tips probably medium Im now using Comply tips size small So its possible the seal isnt quite as good The seal still FEELS as good and the bass is as good as I remember it being back then so I dont think theres a seal issue but you never know The box with the tips in it is very good Makes it easy to keep them separated My right ear is hurting a bit but I think thats because I tried the small tip in that ear for a while and I think they were jammed in further or a hard surface was pushing on my ear where it wasnt with the medium Ive switched back to the medium and will report back on this later Call quality is good I just had a 25 min phone call with my boss and he said he could hear me clearly He said it sounded like I was a bit further from the mic but also that that may be because he was outside a loud restaurant in the wind ie It may have been a problem at his end Ill report back on this too I cant get Gemini Live to work properly I can invoke it with the magic words but it cant seem to hear me after that I can use Google Assistant by pressing and holding my right bud though and thats fine for me Gemini will cost money after the first year  Actually I think this may be my own stupid fault I have a1 month free trial but I havent activated it so I suspect thats why its not working Im not interested in paying 30 per month for AI so I doubt Ill try it No sound leakage At least according to my wife Im listening at 80db lying next to her in bed and she said she cant hear it at allIm very interested to see how well it cancels wind noise when listening to media The XM4s do a good job of thatSUMMARY AFTER SEVERAL HOURS USE Theyre very good Ill be keeping them and will probably sell the XM4s Biggest reasons comfort fit touch controls case removing from case One word convenience So far theyre exactly what I need from a pair of buds like this Very good allrounders and everything is easy I wouldnt buy them for DEDICATED music listening ie sitting and listening with eyes closed but for listening while DOING theyre great Since buying IEMs I dont think Id ever buy TWS buds for dedicated listening although Ive not tried anything 500 but I suspect Ill end up listening to more music on these and more of each song simply because I can easily and comfortably listen while doing other stuff I havent had a chance to exercise in them yet but Im betting thatll be fineEDIT  I went for a good walk with these in this morning 1hr 40min of hard walking Sweated quite a bit Spent about 13 of the walk listening to an audiobook and about 23 on the phone They felt secure the whole time and pretty comfortable A slight discomfort but nothing terrible I didnt feel driven to adjust the fit the whole time When I did twist and push when I got home though the right one had lost its seal Also I noticed a rustling sound with every step I believe this was slight movement of the tips It wasnt a showstopper but its not something I hear with my XM4s and the Comply buds Ive now switched to a pair of Spinfit CP155 tips so see how they go Just sitting they feel a little more seated but I wont know for sure until I go for a walk tomorrow morning Ill report back then My phone call recipient was my boss and I talk to him a lot on my walks He said there was less wind noise on these than normal It felt nicerefreshing to not have the huge XM4s in my ears Not that the big body of those buds makes them uncomfortable for me but you still know theyre there eg You cant feel the movement of air on that part of your outer ear ANC wind noise management touch controls all worked fineEDIT The Spinfits are no good The buds dont charge in the case with them on and they made the same rustling noise I tried a pair of Symbio tips which are a hybrid with silicone outer and foam inner and they fit the buds fine didnt stop them charging although they seem to impede the magnet a little when dropping the buds into the case and they dont adversely affect the bass They also seem not to make the rustling noise as much But they reduced the effectiveness of the ANC so for now Ive switched back to the stock tipsFINAL EDITIve decided to send them back After wearing them for several hours today I began to find them fairly painful in my left ear Bummer Have ordered a pair of Sony Linkbuds S instead","2024-09-27 05:56:18"

"Positive","Pixel Buds are the worst product Ive ever owned.It might be my fault for sticking to the original Pixel Buds the ones that came before the Buds A and the Buds Pro but hey it was early 2021 Google only sold these and there was no announcement of new earbuds from them reviews werent TOO bad so I went for itAnd oh boy was it the worst experience Ive ever had from start to finishIt started with having to replace them for literally 4 times as they always kept disconnecting from my phone and didnt want to reconnect until kept in the case for 510 minutes Also every single one of them always had some degree of case defect as the lid didnt align to the rest of the case making an awful sound when closing Hey at least the last pair of earbuds seemed decent enough on this regard and only disconnected once every 1020 days it wasnt too bad after all Well unfortunately issues didnt end there Because of course how did I not think that they could have disparity issues Like they constantly and consistently dispaired making the left earbud play sound first and then came the right one And the only way to fix this was to stop any audio coming from them wait for a couple of seconds and then play again Oh also did I mention that they have ALWAYS had a kind of background noise when anything was playing It was horrible silence apparently cannot exist with them Pixel Buds Anyways issues persisted all the time Ive owned them and recently new ones started appearing such as the right earbud only lasting literally A QUARTER of the time the left one does Well this of course only happens when Im just listening to anything because when Im in a call they only last 1520 minutes And last but not least some of these buds sometimes think theyre charging when theyre actually not and sometimes they think the case is open while its actually notBefore anyone says anything yes Ive contacted multiple times Google support even with Google One and they always had the same troubleshooting process charge them and factory reset them Needless to say this didnt work everAnyways yes this looks like a rant and it probably is These Pixel Buds are the reason I will never again buy any more buds from Google they have absolutely awful support and theyre terrible on every aspect Ive also never owned any other wireless earbuds before so I cant even say theyre terrible compared to X No theyre terrible period All this for an even more awful price tag of 200  Thats disgusting And no Im not trying to boycott Google I own a Pixel phone and a Pixel Watch and theyre great Great price not so much for the watch but if we compare it to Apples and great functionalities But come on is this really all they can do with some earbudsI hope they fixed these issues on their newer buds but in the meantime I hope to have warned any potential Pixel Buds buyer You might have a terrible experience Thanks for reading","2024-06-04 11:59:37"

ways of doing things yet  I also ran an Apple Watch Ultra and Pixel Watch 3 since release day too so will mention those at the endTLDR   Both phones have plusses and minuses and both are excellent you wont be disappointed with either Watches AW Ultra has a better battery and is tougher but more expensive than the PW3 but the PW3 seems better at tracking sleep and fitness for me see comment about HR readings on UltraiPhone iOS18 observationsTap top of screen to scroll up is a feature I really miss on the Pixel  Its so useful note I am aware of the android app that does this but its flaky and crapPlaying music hands free using Siri  if Im cooking I can tell Siri to play music and it does it  Pixel Gemini wont as it says it needs to be unlocked first Very irritating  There is a workaround for this which is to use your Pixel Watch if you have one as an extended unlock item and use your home address as extended unlock but there shouldnt need to beAdd reminders handsfree using Siri  same as above  I can tell Siri to add a reminder about something and it does it every time pretty much perfectly  Pixel again asks to be unlocked firstAdd locationbased reminders hands free using Siri  can ask Siri to remind me to do something when I get home  I have no idea what Gemini is doing here  Most of the time it just says it cant do that but occasionally it says it has done it but nothing happens  And very occasionally it adds a Google keep reminder that doesnt announce itself but is there  This is my biggest bugbear with GeminiCustomising lock screen better on my iPhone in my opinion  I love swiping for different colours looks and backgrounds interfacing with my photos and stuff  And I LOVE the multicoloured timeUsing collections of images as lock screen pictures  this is such a brilliant feature I was astonished to find Google no longer do this  I can make a folder of family photos and have them swap on my lock screen Why cant Pixel again yes Im aware there is software for this but I havent managed to find one thats free that works the same without ads or isnt flaky etcInteraction generally between calendar reminders and Siri is just more flexible and powerful than on the Pixel  Every option I need is on there  Location based reminders repeating adding locations with a link to Maps everything  Pixels is a bit of a mess and tasks is so limited BafflingBouncing animated photos  where you can get a topshot image eg short video and select it to bounce back and forth This can produce some really cool effects and looks good in the photos app  Not possible on PixelCopy and paste from phone to MacBookiPad and viceversa  This is such a handy feature and I use it all the time  Obviously Pixel is unable to do thisAirPlay to my Sonos speakers in Apple Music Yes Im a weirdo and use AM not Spotify  I love being able to cast to speakers through AM not the Sonos app Yes I know Spotify can cast to any Sonos speakers though which AM cant natively so this is a bonus for PixelThe Journal app  I actually use this and there is no equivalent Pixel app as default happy to hear peoples recommendations here for one which works with iOSAndroidWiFi QR codesshare WiFi password  this is new in iOS18 and is really handy as it works cross platform As far as I know it isnt on PixelSafari reading mode  I hate adverts I mean I really really HATE modern advertising  So I use this feature all the time  Pixel does not have it But actually Pixel has a better solution to this with an app from Google  See my comments on my Pixel listRemoving annoying ads in Safari  another iOS18 feature God I love this Just delete all those shitty irritating adverts and read in peace Works in MacOS tooMeasurements tool  I use this quite a lot in my job and its great  I work in Health and Safety and often need to measure room sizes  The measure tool works really well Image crop to screen size  another small but neat feature  If you zoom in on an image to fill the screen a box comes up asking you if you want to crop the image to make a perfect wallpaper sized imageSwipe down to search is much much more comprehensive than Swipe up to search in Pixel I use this feature a lot and its great  In fact I use this to do almost everything  You can search for videos photos by person or by subject eg dog beach York Minster etc music emails images apps news stories anything  Its brilliant  The Pixel one is just really really limitedKeyboard space bar moved cursor in any direction on the Apple keyboard the Google one only moves left and right This is tedious and annoying when the spelling or change is at the start of the message and fruitlessly tapping close to it is annoying  Apples solution is just better hereNote on keyboards I have come to realise that I used to endlessly moan about the Apple keyboard and how annoying it was but the Pixel one is as bad for me so it must be down to my swiping inaccuracy in the main There is no noticeable difference for me between themNight view mode in landscape at night is great and works really well as a bedside clock  And a wave of the hand brings up the time in red at night if you wake up  Really nice featureCalendar entries If you ask Siri to tell you your calendar entries it will tell you all of them including shared calendar entries Gemini can only tell you Google calendar entries  Siri is pretty shitty generally but this is one area it really nailsApple Pay is less faffy and seems far more reliable than Google Pay for me so far I seem to keep having to unlock my Google Pay and reswiping every time  And if I have a store card it just gets completely confused  And I often have to fish around to get the machine to read my phone  Apple Pay just works logically and perfectly every single timeApple fitness on the watch works really well with synchronising exercise and videos together setting reminders to work out and so on  Just really well thought outScreen attention and by extension face unlock is much better on the iPhone Pixel locks the screen if I am wearing my reading glasses or in a dark room sometimesNow for my Pixel observationsNote these are for Google Pixel Pro 9 XL and Android 14Now playing on the lock screen is brilliant for a music fan like me Just love love love this featureNow Playing list saving all music it has heard and having a shortcut on the home screen  So I dont even need to pay attention now I can take a look later at what the song was  Such a cool featureWatch later for YouTube suggestions previews in Netflix accessed directly from notifications  This is brilliant and so much easier than ApplesNotifications are a bit better generally but I  particularly love YouTube suggestions that I can cast to my TV by a single tap from the notification or adding something to a watch list suggestion from Three BBC etcReplying directly to messages from the notifications is great too  Apple just doesnt do thisCast to my Sonos speakers in Spotify I dont use it but my daughter does and its really cool to cast in the Spotify app to any Sonos speakers iPhone can only cast to some of my Sonos speakers not all of themGemini generally better than Siri by a mile except having to unlock phone nonsense and points mentioned above regarding calendar and location based reminders etc Its such a shame it isnt all integrated properly because it frankly makes Siri look embarrassing for most stuff  Night and day better for asking about events places facts news stories pretty much anything Siris Ive found this on the web is embarrassing and its not going to be until at least first Quarter 2025 before it improvesPixel screenshots is really handy too just started using this and find it useful  Its great you can create reminders from it as well but why does it not back it all up  AnnoyingNight Sight camera is amazing  Four minute long exposure images very coolNot sure whether I prefer Google Photos or Apple for memories editing and so on  They are pretty closely matched for me Not sure I like the iOS18 photos app yet to be honest so Google Photos probably gets the nod here at the moment but its very close  Both are some of the best software that Google and Apple have to offerGemini live isnt there yet  The DEI and  preaching crap it keeps bringing up is really annoying I dont need my phone to remind me that all people are equal or women should be respected every time I ask for a fact about employment figures thanks Google  It also needs to be able to talk to normal Gemini to create links show photos play music and so on And do it when the phone is still locked GoogleCall screening  I havent used it yet but presuming it works its a great featureThe reading mode in Safari is something I mentioned that I love for the iPhone  Google has a free download called Reader mode and you can set it up to activate using a two finger swipe up from bottom of screen  this is actually better than iOS in some ways because it works in the news reader and loads of other apps too It doesnt include images though which the Apple Safari one does This doesnt come preinstalled thoughRecorder app with summary and text translation is a great featureSplit screen although it is a bit flaky on Android 14  Reddit always crashes using it for example  Maybe they will fix it for Android 15 or remove itHold for me Amazing if it works again I havent used it yet thoughDirect my call as aboveNotification history is a nice touch  being able to look back at all my notifications if I accidentally deleted one NiceGemini feature ask about this screen  option appears if this is available on the screen and you can ask questions about it Works quite wellSelecting text via the app switcher is niceGoogle news  you can block any providers you dont like completely Apple news leaves a big sign there saying you have blocked this news provider  click here to unblock which is a big screw you from Apple as far as I can seeGoogle lens although this is coming in iOS is quite cool tooMagic eraser is really good for removing things from photos works far better than I thought possible Again it is coming to iOS in the coming months  I used the beta though and it was poorNow a couple of observations about smart watchesApple watch Ultra has better battery life but the PW3 will still happily get you through 24 hours including sleep tracking working out and listening to musicSleep tracking seems more accurate on my Pixel Watch 3 my AW seems to badly underestimate deep sleepExercise stuff seems pretty similar although I should note that on my Ultra my HR monitor always disconnects corrupting my data  Very annoying  Note that all my normal AW did not do this and were fineIt is much easier and better to get new watch faces on the Pixel Watch On AW this is really flaky and annoying if you arent using the standard facesUltra is far tougher than the pixel Watch Im still nervous about scratching my PW3I personally prefer the strap system of the Apple watch Still waiting for my pixel buds pro 2s so no comparison there yetWell I hope anybody looking to move between Pixel and Apple finds some of this useful  Im sure I will get plenty of posts with solutions for Pixel that are like iPhone features If so thanks  And remember these are just my observations and opinions","2024-09-25 08:14:30"

"Positive","Pixel Buds 2 Pro Eary impressions  comparison with Sony WF1000XM4.I preordered my Buds 2 Pro on Sept 1 and they arrived today Sydney Australia Early impressions and comparions with Sony WF1000XM4 below Note that I bought then immediately sent back the original Pixel Buds Pro when they were first released in favour of keeping the XM4s As others have said theyre very small and light Fit feels good Im not sure I have the right sized tips in yet Im just using the mediums so far but they definitely feel secure They dont move at all when I shake my head around The real test though is sweat Ill wear them on my walk tomorrow hopefully to test if the seal breaks continually Thats the usual problem I have with buds I pretty much solved it with Comply tips on the XM4s Oh and I tested eating with them in and they didnt move YMMV but great for me I could sleep in these but I have pretty big ears so they dont stick out on me  Slept in them last night All playback controls work every time play pause skip etc I REALLY like that the confirmation beep on skip track is slightly delayed On the XM4s its immediate and I often dont hear it because all I can hear is my tap This is compounded by the fact that the XM4s controls are much harder to hit cleanly so I often end up pausing single tap when Im trying to skip double tap Volume swipe works every time Tap and hold for assistant works every time Assistant is fast and helpful I believe its using my phones chosen assistant I prefer Google Assistant to Gemini still Slight issue the assistants voice MAY be a little too loud for my liking I havent tried reducing it yet and Im not sure I want to because itll probably be a good volume when Im most likely to use it while walking Sound quality is very good Hard to say if its better than the XM4s because I have both EQd But I like the PBP2 setup better than the setup Ive got going on the XM4 at the moment Its all a lot cleaner but still very prominent and clean bass The XM4s sound muddy by comparison I may be able to close that gap by adjusting my EQ but havent tried yet and probably wont Theyre not a patch on my 50 IEMs for sound quality but thats to be expected Eartip seal check didnt work Said there was too much noise even though I was sitting completely still in a quiet room Hearing wellness feature is cool I often worry I have the volume too high but it says Im OK  Thats at about 80dB Conversation detection isnt working out of the box Ive looked hard and theres no setting for it I Googled it and can see that other people have experienced this problem One guy said it magically appeared after a few hours so Ill keep checking back Apparently my firmware is up to date so Ill just have to wait  Yep the toggle setting just appeared after a few hours Weird And yep its good Kicks in in about 12 seconds Love the case Its better than the Pixel Buds A case and definitely better than the XM4 case With the XM4s I always seem to choose the wrong side to open the lid from It seems like a trivial thing I know but still Putting in and out of the case is easier than with the original Pixel Buds Pro Not yet easier than the XM4s but I suspect thats just a question of getting used to it  muscle memoryI cant think of anything else to mention but if you have any questions feel free to ask If I think of anything else later Ill edit my original postEDIT I believe ANC is significantly better than the original Buds Pro from memory They were nowhere near as good as the XM4s The Buds Pro 2 are actually better than the XM4s However its important to note that I have different tips on the XM4s now Back when I compared them to the original Pixel Buds Pro I was using the stock tips probably medium Im now using Comply tips size small So its possible the seal isnt quite as good The seal still FEELS as good and the bass is as good as I remember it being back then so I dont think theres a seal issue but you never know The box with the tips in it is very good Makes it easy to keep them separated My right ear is hurting a bit but I think thats because I tried the small tip in that ear for a while and I think they were jammed in further or a hard surface was pushing on my ear where it wasnt with the medium Ive switched back to the medium and will report back on this later Call quality is good I just had a 25 min phone call with my boss and he said he could hear me clearly He said it sounded like I was a bit further from the mic but also that that may be because he was outside a loud restaurant in the wind ie It may have been a problem at his end Ill report back on this too I cant get Gemini Live to work properly I can invoke it with the magic words but it cant seem to hear me after that I can use Google Assistant by pressing and holding my right bud though and thats fine for me Gemini will cost money after the first year  Actually I think this may be my own stupid fault I have a1 month free trial but I havent activated it so I suspect thats why its not working Im not interested in paying 30 per month for AI so I doubt Ill try it No sound leakage At least according to my wife Im listening at 80db lying next to her in bed and she said she cant hear it at allIm very interested to see how well it cancels wind noise when listening to media The XM4s do a good job of thatSUMMARY AFTER SEVERAL HOURS USE Theyre very good Ill be keeping them and will probably sell the XM4s Biggest reasons comfort fit touch controls case removing from case One word convenience So far theyre exactly what I need from a pair of buds like this Very good allrounders and everything is easy I wouldnt buy them for DEDICATED music listening ie sitting and listening with eyes closed but for listening while DOING theyre great Since buying IEMs I dont think Id ever buy TWS buds for dedicated listening although Ive not tried anything 500 but I suspect Ill end up listening to more music on these and more of each song simply because I can easily and comfortably listen while doing other stuff I havent had a chance to exercise in them yet but Im betting thatll be fineEDIT  I went for a good walk with these in this morning 1hr 40min of hard walking Sweated quite a bit Spent about 13 of the walk listening to an audiobook and about 23 on the phone They felt secure the whole time and pretty comfortable A slight discomfort but nothing terrible I didnt feel driven to adjust the fit the whole time When I did twist and push when I got home though the right one had lost its seal Also I noticed a rustling sound with every step I believe this was slight movement of the tips It wasnt a showstopper but its not something I hear with my XM4s and the Comply buds Ive now switched to a pair of Spinfit CP155 tips so see how they go Just sitting they feel a little more seated but I wont know for sure until I go for a walk tomorrow morning Ill report back then My phone call recipient was my boss and I talk to him a lot on my walks He said there was less wind noise on these than normal It felt nicerefreshing to not have the huge XM4s in my ears Not that the big body of those buds makes them uncomfortable for me but you still know theyre there eg You cant feel the movement of air on that part of your outer ear ANC wind noise management touch controls all worked fineEDIT The Spinfits are no good The buds dont charge in the case with them on and they made the same rustling noise I tried a pair of Symbio tips which are a hybrid with silicone outer and foam inner and they fit the buds fine didnt stop them charging although they seem to impede the magnet a little when dropping the buds into the case and they dont adversely affect the bass They also seem not to make the rustling noise as much But they reduced the effectiveness of the ANC so for now Ive switched back to the stock tipsFINAL EDITIve decided to send them back After wearing them for several hours today I began to find them fairly painful in my left ear Bummer Have ordered a pair of Sony Linkbuds S instead","2024-09-27 05:56:18"
"Positive","Pixel Buds Pro 2s  my first couple of hours.Hi allSo my pair arrived this morning and I already have a few thoughts on them  Please bear in mind these are just my opinions and Im not a pro reviewer or anythingFirstly wow these are so small and light  They make my airpod pro 2s feel big  They are really comfy to wear too Setting up on my Pixel was a doddle and there was an update already to the software to 2117 for buds and 155 for caseThe sound on them for me is excellent and I like them as much as my Airpod Pro 2s  I havent played with the EQ and probably wont to be honest because songs are recorded at so many different levels youll be constantly fiddling with it so I just leave it as is  Im also over fifty now so my hearing isnt top notchThe noise cancelling is excellent and I would say as good as my Airpod Pro 2s as well so far All of it feels really nicely made the earphones snap into the case nicely and I look forward to seeing what the battery life is likeNow for the problemsNow this is the first pair of Pixel Buds I have owned but the touch stuff is seriously problematic under certain situations for me so far  I took the dog out for a walk to test them and everything was great initially but then it started raining and suddenly everything went to shit  Even though we were quite dry in a wood sheltering my fingers became damp and the earphones stopped responding  The music just stopped and the only way to get it to play again was using my phoneThen when I put my hood up and starting jogging back the hood must have kept brushing the tips and starting and stopping the music and putting the noise cancelling on and off  Very annoying Especially in the rain with a dogAnyway once this happened it was like the earphones crashed  Putting them back in the case then taking them out again got them working properly again  So I dont know if this is a software glitch or not but Im not going back out into the rain too test then againAnother thing is knowing where to tap them  You cant see the side of your head so you when you go to pause them for instance you tend to be putting the volume up and down and jumping forwards and backwards a track  Im going to give them a while but this is really annoying for me at the moment  Airpods just work so much better in this regardAnyway these are just my initial thoughts after a few hours  Perhaps after some use Ill get better accustomed to the pads and how to use them  I hope so because theyre lovely and sound and cancelling are greatEDIT Forgot to mention the Gemini integration is working really well so far in the limited use I have made for itEDIT2 multipoint connection works really really well for meEDIT3 after saying all that about the multi point its stopped working  Nothing will play on my Pixel now  I had to put the buds back in the box shut down all my media apps shut my MacBook and reopen media apps on my Pixel to get it to work  Poor  Hopefully sorted with an update sometime in the future Sigh ","2024-09-26 11:02:16"

"Positive","Switched from Pixel 7 to iPhone 16 Pro My Observations After a Week of Heavy Use.Ive been an Android user for over a decade with a string of Pixels in recent years My last iPhone was the iPhone 3 I think so its been a long time Ive always liked the flexibility of Android plus the fact that Googles ecosystem isnt closedmeaning in theory I could switch to iPhone at any time without too much hassleBut my Pixel 7 had been giving me headaches especially with Google Messages failing to receive texts in group chats I dont know if it was the phone or my carrier but after months of frustration I finally gave in Seeing the sheer number of iPhones around me plus the way Apple is constantly hyped up in media I figuredwhy not Maybe I was missing outSo a week ago I used an upgrade from my carrier to get the iPhone 16 Pro Here are my thoughts so far How I Use My PhoneI use my phone for both work and personal life and a lot of that involves typingemails messaging across multiple apps etc I rely on crossplatform apps like WhatsApp Gmail Outlook Salesforce and many Google services Google News Drive Keep Gmail Maps YouTube Music etc The Good Hardware Quality A really nice piece of hardware Beautiful solid and feels great in hand The Pro model is a good sizebig but not too bulky Screen Looks fantastic No complaints Camera  Video Takes excellent shots and from all accounts the video quality is toptier Dynamic Island First time hearing about it but its actually pretty cool Having sports scores and music controls right there is surprisingly useful Software Touches Some effects and animations are really smoothlike when scanning a document it isolates the background and seamlessly moves it into the corner CarPlay This surprised me When catching up on notifications it gives a naturallanguage summary of missed messages which is really nice    The Apple Maps navigation voice and style is very natural and smoothI actually prefer it to Google Maps I guess the days of being navigated into a lake are over for Apple Maps Grouped Notifications While I still think Android does notifications better Apples grouping and summarization of sameapp notifications is intelligently designed and useful FaceID When youre holding the phone FaceID works perfectlyfast and accurate However if the phone is sitting on a desk or table FaceID often wont pick up your face unless you awkwardly lean over it A fingerprint reader would be a really nice option in those situations Standby Mode Standby mode at night with the bedside alarm clock in red was actually very nice and welldesigned Its subtle but easy to read at night without being harsh on the eyes Also the default iPhone alarm tone is exceptionally pleasingway better than the jarring tones Im used to on Android GenMoji Seems Fun I didnt even try it once but I bet its cool for those who are into that sort of thing The BadThese arent new complaints about iOS but for someone using it as a main device they are massive hurdles The Keyboard is Borderline Unusable Whether using the stock keyboard or Gboard on iOS the experience is awful So many typos wrong key pressesits just bad The Gboard on my old Pixel 7 was 1000x more accurate and faster to type on It has been consistently infuriating I had no idea just how much better the Android keyboard was Notifications  Anxiety Machine iPhone is aggressive with notificationsway more than I was used to On Android you can easily choose which notifications for a given app should be silent or not right from the notification itselfjust a quick tap and done On iPhone its a much more laborious process requiring you to dig into settings manually for each app This makes it way harder to finetune notifications to be useful instead of overwhelming Speaking of Settings Why is there a whole app called Settings instead of just swiping down and tapping an icon to adjust things quickly Having to navigate through an app for simple things like WiFi or Bluetooth is an unnecessary step No App Drawer This is insane Instead of a clean app drawer you have to either search for apps which is fine but not intuitive or look through Apples premade categories in the App Library The grouping seems neat at first glance but ends up being a wild choice in actual use Why do I have to rely on Apple to decide where my apps go CarPlay Layout is a Mess Apple Maps is actually pretty solid nownaturalsounding navigation accurate directionsbut the overall CarPlay interface is clunky compared to Android Auto    If you use Google Maps on CarPlay without a car screen just on your phone you can only get inapp media controls for Spotify or Apple Musicnot YouTube Music Why iMessage is Seriously Underwhelming I was expecting more RCS on Android does the same thing minus the blue bubble exclusivity so the fact that Apple has built an entire bullying ecosystem around this feels ridiculous WhatsApp does all of this and works across devices    No iMessage on a PC This was a shock I use a PC for work and I was stunned to realize that iMessage has no web or Windows version With Google Messages WhatsApp or basically any other modern messaging platform I could just open a browser and continue conversations while working With iPhone Nope Either use a Mac or be stuck switching between my phone and computer constantly Transferring Old Messages From Android Was a Nightmare This was infuriating Theres no native way to do it so I had to try a thirdparty expensive appand even that still didnt work Homescreen Organization is a Disaster On Android I can place apps and widgets where I wantmaybe I have a family photo as my wallpaper and dont want anything covering faces On iPhone Move one app and the whole homescreen shifts like a chaotic game of Tetris If you try to put an app in a folder its like chasing a toddler at bedtime Just why Final Verdict For NowAll of my complaints seem like they should be obvious to anyone who uses a phone regularly and heavily The keyboard alone makes the iPhone unusable for anyone who has used a functional mobile keyboard before The homescreen mess the notifications anxiety and the lack of a proper back gesture all add up to an experience that feels polished but deeply inefficientSo it appears Ill be switching back to Androidand a Pixel 9 Pro Im sure Ill still have complaints and yeah I know some grown adults will keep whining about green bubbles But whatever I need to get stuff doneWould love to hear from others who made the switch either way Did you stick with it or go back Does anybody ever switch any

Quality  Excellent Feels great to hold When I went to get a cover cafe to get tempered glass from nearby mall the salespeople there held the phone and said its very cute and feels really good It feels premium and compact and you are gonna love it Speaking of tempered glass tho It does NOT come out with a thin film installed on it either and the device being new getting tempered glass is difficult Although I have not seen scratches yet I wont get peace of mind until I get a tempered glass Also the hard plastic back cover feels good to hold but its so tight that I am sure when a tempered glass is installed it will break that from sides These are minor nitpicks Otherwise build quality is amazing Very Bright display too Almost too bright indoors Has HDR10 and HDR10 supportDisplay  Gorgeous 15k by default and no option to switch to 1080p but I dont care Its just that option would have been better in case want to save more battery But the display is sharp For color profile modes Natural is too muted and vivid is too vivid So in between them radiant should be a great middle ground One thing I noticed is that both natural and radiant are warmyellowish tint color calibrated whereas vivid is cooler color calibratedColor modes Vivid has cooler tone and Natural Radiant have warmer

and save battery and 120 option means always 120 That is not true I found auto option to be very finicky It has a sudden jerk while scrolling and stopping and dialing down of refresh rate is very aggresive in auto so I switched to 120 and thank God its smoother and it infact does dial down to 1 pretty regularly like auto but not aggressively I would recommend leaving it on 120 rather than Auto

"Positive","Pixel 9 Pro XL is Amazing.I just gotta come here and express my gratitude towards Google for actually fixing and changing the many issues with their previous devices To preface Ive been a long time iPhone user who dabbles with the android ecosystem I used to flipflop back and forth each year between Apple and Google up until the Pixel 4 but then I felt like googles devices couldnt keep up with some of the hardware Apple uses on their devices Most recently I really tried to love the P8P but there was so many issues I couldnt see past that would degrade the experience of the device As with my job I cant really be near a charger at all times one of my main issues was the terrible battery life of the Pixel 8 Pro I wouldnt even make it through an 810 hour shift comfortably with the Pixel 8 Pro And it wasnt solely for screen on time but mainly standby time that was the culprit Of course screen time would degrade my battery life even quicker but as it was in my pocket for a few hours and Id go back onto my phone seeing that it lost 15 percent battery life was extremely unsettling Id constantly limit background usage turn 5G off an use LTE strictly turn off location services And although that helped slightly I dont believe you should limit your phone in a bunch of different ways to be able to prolong battery lifeI always also experienced laggingstuttering issues with the 8 Pro This issue is self explanatory and not much to say other than it seriously degraded the experience of using the phoneOverheating Yeah that was an issue constantly Id be using maps on my car and my phone would have an overheating warning In direct sunlight Id have an overheating warning Etc it was just a constant battle The modem on the 8 Pro was AWFUL Such spotty service dropped calls and again limiting to LTE instead of 5G just to have improvements on the battery life Now with the P9PXL oh my what a drastic difference And of course this is my experience with the device but battery has been amazing The standby times have been excellent no need to limit background usage limit to LTE turn down screen resolution Yesterday I had over 4 hours SOT and the device was still at 50 ish percent battery life by the time I got home I was using the camera maps daily texting phone calls emails social media and this device just handled it so well The modem is crazy good Id argue better than apples I live in the basement of my house and on either the 8 Pro or 15 Pro Max Id get one bar or no bars in my room P9PXL is sitting at 3 bars right now in a room I struggled to have service in Havent experienced a single dropped call using 5G and this modem is killing it allOverheating hasnt been an issue at all This phone remains cool with my usage patterns because of that new vapor chamber Havent had a single overheating issue whether using android auto or just being outside on my deviceStuttering hasnt been an issue at all The UI has been buttery smooth No hiccups or stuttering The new fingerprint sensor works flawlessly Im using a tempered glass screen protector and it just reads my fingerprint without delay Messing around with the add me feature on the camera and the magic eraser its just crazy what AI on a device can do Some of the features are a gimmick in my opinion but some of these features are seriously QOL features With RCS finally available on iPhone well currently to those who have the iOS 18 beta texting between iPhone and Android has been lovely with those read receipts reply features no horribly compressed photosvideos I say this with full confidence but I genuinely feel like this is finally a Pixel year for me Im seriously loving everything about this phone ","2024-08-28 14:58:00"
"Positive","iOS vs Android Pixel comparison Part 1 Why Pixel Outshines iPhone.As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel Ive noticed several areas where Pixel excels Heres my breakdown  Edit Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom due to community rules 1 Advanced Notification System Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and current playback in the notification center notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful Intuitive notification management eg disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app  2 Clear Interactive System Information Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone Alarm volume feedback when you miss an alarm it shows you that volume of your alarm is low Reminder to close Incognito pages after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on  3 Robust File Management PClike file system with enhanced filtering All your documents from whatever app you use you will find it in the documents tap Same for images Its universal same as the PC Because files controls all Its better cleaning of cluttering files  4 Enhanced User Interface Google search bar on home screen and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS Maybe because its older feature so Its much adopted You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and Im addicted to it right now Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for nonnative English speakers  5 Multimedia and Connectivity More practical PictureinPicture PiP functionality Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay especially for web pages and not so popular website Specially in background continuity of the casting You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet  6 Communication Features Full call history logs Easy one here iPhone   7 Customization and Productivity Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature Specially you can pin you copies for ever The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it In this way you will have bigger windows but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as its on chrome browser on windows Its fast accurate and never disappoint you Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons  8 App Availability I dont why but Android in general have collection of not wellknown apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use For example in Android in IPTV 9stream You cannot find similar app on iPhone Downloading apps from outside the Play store gives you the freedom you have on windows  9 Device Analysis Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights Part 2 why iOS in some parts outperform Android PixelNow the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel 1 Better Face UnlockiOSs Face ID is still the best in class Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure For example it cannot verify your wallet payment 2 Unified Call HistoryHaving all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important I know some users hate this feature but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work 3 Spotlight SearchSpotlight search is the Feature No 1 that I wish android has One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device even files documents photos For example if you swipe down and type passport iOS will give you the passport document in Files app in addition to the Passport screenshots photos in your Photos app 4 Text Cursor ControlHold space to move the cursor making text editing easier Better than the one in Gboard 5 Privacy in TrackingBetter control and transparency over app tracking 6 VPN in SafariBuiltin VPN support while Google Ones VPN isnt available in my country 7BestinClass AccessoriesAir Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone  For example If I wear the AirPods while Im watching Youtube in the Apple TV notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone neat featureAlso you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone 8 Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight 9CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay Carplay is far more stable and reliable I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado and I never having it disconnected from the car In Android two three times a week 10Touch Screen QualityI dont why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel Its more accurate and shorter response time 11 Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devicesThis is an important point Document folder in iOS iCloud is the same on all Apple devices So without uploading or backing up files If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device 12Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also 13 Stable and Polished AppsAndroid has made good leap on this part but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts 14iMessage and FacetimeFor me Facetime is really handy iMessage are major for the users in US For us here we use WhatsApp mainlywe reach the end I hope  its helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons","2024-07-05 08:33:43"
"Positive","Went from Pixel 4a to Pixel 8a Here are my observations so far.Ive had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years got it in 2021 Very happy with it I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area Despite being very happy with the 4a I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a I decided to go for that instead Here are my observations so far THIS PHONE IS BIG On paperhttpsiimgurcomHzp3HbIpng the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size The 8a is bigger but it is not considered to be a big phonehttpsiimgurcommdAphoEpng nowadays In reality there is a very noticeable size difference The 8a feels huge Not only is it noticeably taller and wider but it is tangibly heavier too This phone is HEAVY My 4a in its case is 184g and the 8a is 237g You can feel those 53 grams They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either Bezels galore It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size This is not a one handed use phone at least not comfortably THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH If you dont know the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling you can Google it there are plenty of reports from users I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz Side note Pixel 9 also stutters 9 Pro  9 Pro XL are smooth And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15 it is in fact not fixed I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth It is incredibly smooth This is how 120Hz should look and feel Once you try out the 120Hz mode 60Hz looks terrible I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz the downgrade is immediately noticeable I only noticed stuttering with 9gag the app stutters in any mode but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade or going into settings It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings The screen is great THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR HOW I LAMENT THOUThe 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor It was a Pixel line signature feature Super convenient and worked reliably Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8aUPDATE It is awful and unusable Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock BATTERY The 8a is new so the battery life is great But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life Ive had two 4a Pixels the first one had decent battery life the second one though drains very quickly for some reason I have to charge it several times a day so a better battery is very welcome Charging is slow on the 8a but to me it really does not matter The 4a charged slowly too and it did not bother me much After trying it a bit more the 8a is better than the 4a but it is not as great as I thought it would be Not a full day battery life phone you will need to change it at least once throughout the day Here is an example of the battery drain overnight Started with 80 batteryhttpsipostimgccMxzkX26pIMG20241210000007jpg Dropped to 67 overnighthttpsipostimgccZZHGd7nFIMG20241210100123jpg The conditions here Connectivity through LTE all the apps closed the screen was off the whole time I missed the alarm maybe that took one or two percent If we account for that it is 1112 drop overnight A FLAGSHIP SOC WHO NEEDS IT I never had any complaints with the 4as speed and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I dont play games The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC To be honest though I dont notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a Both open apps browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite THE RAM The 4a has 6GB of RAM the 8a has 8GB of RAM Have I noticed any improvements in daytoday use Absolutely not Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memoryTHE ROBOT I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them I dont care if a feature is big or small I only care about how useful it is For example manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature but I love it It make a big difference for me The 8a came with Android 14 I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15 There are some good features like  Circletosearch is cool  Although I thought Id be using it all the time I havent used it once so far Private space is nice  A good feature to have Havent had the need for it yet I like the new back icon its animation how it snaps off from the edge  Predictive back gesture animation is great  I think if this animation is used then the above back icon animation is unnecessary Right now its the two of them at once Pin autoconfirm is good to have very handy with the new finger print sensor  Ive used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isnt great USBC to monitor video streaming is good  Havent used it yet  There is partial screen recording  Havent had the need for it yet but good to have The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80 charge limit  I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options which I dont really use but overall I dont feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all This is a bit of a different topic but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23 That has killed a few good apps that I used It and Pixel 8a also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely This change me made look over the apps I use and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available Made me want to stick to Android 13 Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked

not swipe them away by accident It was so convenient Not sure why they changed that Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it LIGHTS CAMERA ACTION I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade at best Its all probably due to the higher resolution So far the 8a is a bit warmer and resolves just a tiny almost unnoticeable amount of detail The camera app is alright but yet again it really lacks pro options I wonder if its developers are into photography at all At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values but those settings reset and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session The reason you want to lock them is because Pixels white balance is all over the place depending on the angle Two photos taken within seconds of each other just at a different angle with auto white balancehttpsipostimgccPt9wMz4wScreenshot20230715115403jpg I still consider Nokia Lumias camera apphttpswwwwindowslatestcomwpcontentuploads201710WindowsCamerajpg to be superior I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential It can take nicer shots There is no Camera PX for the 8a Here is an example of I dont care what gcam app you use just squeeze out the best this phone can do handheld The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right Fan  Low lighthttpsipostimgccKmFCHT594avs8a202412021jpg  The 4a has more grain and that radiation texture at 100 resolution but it is sharper focused and has more details The moment you downsize it it looks noticeably betterFan  Realistic low lighthttpsipostimgccfDY6CCYt4avs8a202412022jpg  Again the 4a is better Close up focus is not good on the 8a The 4a focuses closer and its photos are sharper even when 2x magnification is used The 8as camera makes everything BRIGHT In automatic mode it turns night into a day The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera but I feel like its pretty useless At least I havent had a need for it And when I tried the quality is rather poor Would have preferred a 2x telephoto UPDATE I have used the ultrawide several times now and I really started appreciating its usefulness especially with video But the quality is poor Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8ahttpspostimgccgallery9z9tbdM Ill add some more photos as I goI absolutely hated video quality on the 4a I feel like it took horrendous 4K video They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter and it just looked awfulhttpsimgurcomapixel4avideoqualitySaKfzup I actually preferred the OG Pixels 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a which was ok still not great but not as bad as the 4K mode The 8as video is better both 1080p and 4k It looks pretty good to me Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times It is something a few YouTube reviewers have mentioned beforehttpsyoutubeACIqHX9SpUwt595 Hopefully it gets improved in the future The 8as LED light is weaker the 4as is noticeably brighter HAPTICS Haptics are different I feel like the 4a has more punch It hits more noticeably maybe because its smaller The 8as haptics feel more internal somehow Going from the OG Pixels vibration motor to the 4as haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics It was a totally new better experience Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics Havent tried those extensively though CONNECTIVITY The cell reception is good have not noticed any issues or had any complaints Never had any complaints with 4a either The GNSS reception is excellenthttpsipostimgccrcYKkWBqGPSData2024121102png The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m The 8a gets down to 2mhttpsipostimgcc1Pzf2MYWGPSData2024121101jpg Picks up GPS GLONASS Galileo BeiDou all of them256GB PLEASE The model that was available to me was the 128GB one I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a 256GB would be a welcome upgrade but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option 256GB should be the minimum storage THE REST Speakers are louder than the 4a Clearer Not certain about that one But louder for sure An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a As soon as I inserted it I received a SIM not supported message Apparently newer Pixels require the Class C 18V sim card Ive ordered a replacement SIM I really hope that fixes it UPDATE That fixed it So if you are getting the SIM not supported message get a new Class C 18V replacement from your carrier You probably dont need to specify the class to them just a replacement it should be the new type that will be compatible Havent tried 5G at all I do not need it The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB TypeC which was introduced in Android 13 but the 4a did not have the drivers for it Transferring things is tedious I havent found a way to move eSIMs over IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13 the X7 Ultra the vivo X100 Ultra I dont know about that now After trying the 8a I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra which is the same size as the OnePlus and others I have no idea how people manage that Those phones are gigantic Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone but when the time comes they buy the bigger one I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version I would love a 58 Pixel again but with tiny bezels like on the Galaxy S24 Or even better a 55 120Hz screen with tiny bezelshttpsipostimgccjj3QfQfXS244a4amini13minipng Going back to the 4as 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly and the phone is such a joy to use I love its size THE FOLLOW UPI dont know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a I love the 120Hz smoothness and yes I can yet again confirm unlike the Pixel 8 the 8a is smooth But the phone is big and heavy I dont really know what I upgraded The camera is the same a bit worse in certain areas the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all 4G is enough for me the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it and it works well and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without 80 charge limit is good but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as its the same size as the 8a and it has a telephoto lens or maybe the S25 The XLPlus phones are not for me The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera akin to the legendary Nokia 808

"Positive","Pixel 9 Pro XL Light review coming from a long time user of Apple products .Heres a very light review after 3 days Changed as was bored with IPhones and iOS Been using them constantly since IPhone 3GS Been a good ride Now change has come Apple does make some good products Havent changed phones since 10 XS Max as Ive been waiting for that damn island to disappear 16 was the straw Also not a fan of apple rebranding everything to their liking apple intelligence and their hypocritical sales policy Youre not a force for good youre just like most companies in it for the money stop pretending Always been in the garden but never ever a fan boy Being a fan boygirl for technology is ridiculous Be a fan of peace politeness and respect and good things like good food good weather good times and  good tech regardless of the brand  Love the box Minimal and eminently recyclable I know it costs them peanuts but still its a gorgeous minimalist eco design Better than the shoeboxes from before All you need I look at and use my phone not the boxcasing If a lack of wall charger or earbuds surprises you nowadays youre in for a hard lifeLighter than my 10 XS Max Most phones probably are nowadays Form reminds me of a cross between iPhone 6 S Plus Max cant remember and iPhone 5 for some reason but they were my personal fave iPhones Definitely a beauty Rocking the silicone google case Simplicity Plus have insurance so not worried about crippling drops Set upmoving across was a breeze Used a cable Took about an hourDont mind redoing all my passwords like keychain or 1 Password Gotta delete a lot So an excuse to spring clean Disappointed with subscription 1Password bought a premium account twice a while ago Bitwarden seems to be working fine Also no heating issues at all Phone temperature stayed ambient like the room Even everyday usage doesnt heat it at all But then I dont game or watch filmsseries on it thats what the Sony UHD and PS5 is for I do watch a few Premier League matches a day though on the weekends Bonus Sony uses Android TV so I can control and talk to my TV What a world we live in Scary And good Keyboard is noiiiice Love the haptic feedback without clicks As I have stubby thumbsfingers like pigs tits typing seems to be pleasurable again Had to retype everything on iPhone although my fault shouldve used swipe to type But the predictive text and auto correct seem supremely better I was getting some crazy nonsensical bullshit recently on the iphone Love the numbers at the top of the keyboard permanently And the very quick acces to multiple punctuation marks The one thing missing from ios is the spacebar to move the cursor anywhere not just one line at a time Still not a massive deal Or even a small one Im sure an app may solve it Like jailbreaking Ill live and learn Usage is easy to get used to Swipe gestures are like ios The universal back is a god send Love the simplicity and logic behind usage Although such in depth settings too And deep search within settings Gobsmacked Battery life has been stellar All day 0700  midnight use with 30 left at night 9 hours screen time And Im constantly playing with it and editing photos Which brings me to the camera One of the main reasons for getting this phone Its amazing Does all I want and the quality is crazy good  The built in ai is mind boggling and fun So easy to use especially with the pixel tips app Macro and astrophotography in one bundle count me in The zoom is excellent especially for a phone Add Me is surprisingly useful and a blast especially when adding 2 of the same person Magic Eraser is also useful bettermore convenient than using another app Also changing backgrounds is astoundingly good Portait is also not too bad when you adjust the blur manually The pan and long exposure is fantastic especially on a phone Havent tried much else such as video No bluetooth problems No connection issues at all One of the best things The monochromenight mode Absolutely love it Like I get a new phone each night And the always on lock screen What have I been doing in life to miss out on these thingsGemini is fun too Better than I thought and it does all my tasks easily includung Hue lights TV disappointing but true prognosis for my teams prospects and even opening and playing a song from Apple Music for the lossless still use wired speakers earbuds Plus quickfire questions to prove my kids wrong and that dad knows all Only things missing the spacebar see above the bottom address bar in Chrome and the tap to scroll up know I can get it with Touch the Notch Really not much at all considering the enjoyment and upgrades it brings Absolutely no regrets at all Love it Managed to get Pixel Screenshots and Pixel Studio working even though I live in France Well done APK mirror and side loading not achievable on iphone unless jail broken which I used to do a bit of to get Android features Maybe because my account was originally set up in the UK and I use US English on the phone Who knows They just work Overall a highly recommend phone coming from a 5 year old iphone But highly recommend just the same Magnificent piece of technology hardware os and cloud Maybe Ill be back in a month complaining but I highly doubt it I hope If anyone wants more indepth details or has questions ask away Remember a brief review after just 3 days use coming from

"Positive","A better battery life guide for Pixel phones.Fellow brethren This is something that I did for eeking out the maximum battery on the Pixel without sacrificing any features in the previous guides Ive seen hereSwitching back to 60hz uninstalling social media apps etcSo Ive had the Pixel 8 for almost 2 months now The battery life when I received the phone was around 5hr SOT which got better after the adaptive battery kicked in 6hrs Now as the days passed I felt this itch to squeeze more out of the phone battery I got good reports of battery usage on the Android 15 beta so I switched over Now the SOT became 65hrs Not good enough Then I took the steps below and the phone gets around 8hrs SOT regularly Its also important to note that I never had any issues with my phone like call drops or shitty signal or random reboots etc I use internet and WiFi sparingly and the battery stats here are not just on WiFi Also bear in mind that Im on A15 beta The phone is flawless for me1 Use a really good battery monitor Pixel inline battery monitor is okay but its not great BetterBatteryStats is the king of all monitors But sadly it doesnt work on android 15   So I used two Accubattery and Gsam battery monitor Both are really good But Gsam has more data recording and visualization graphs for heat battery CPU usage and a lot more Also accubattery doesnt record how much battery the phone signal WiFi CPU android system Kernel etc use While Gsam records all those and wakelocks of your phone You can get the premium versions from Mobilism listed in the wiki of rpiracy which I think gives you some extra features You will need to grant Gsam some extra permissions with adb2 Install macrodroid and get the Enhance battery life V2 macro from the macro repository inside the app If you understand feel free to move on to the next one but  If you find the above sentence dense heres a breakdownMacrodroid is an app which executes macrosscripts that you install on the phone For example you can install a macro to turn on flashlight when you shake the phone or turn off WiFi if no networks are detected within 20 seconds etcNow there is a huge repository for macros inside the app itselfin the bottom panel and then search for it and the one that you want to install is called Enhance battery life V2 macro This enables battery saver when the phone is locked Locking it to 60hz and putting tasks into idle quicker Hence you get very low standby drain on the phone You might need to give macrodroid admin rights on the phone and enable androidpermissionsWRITESECURESETTINGS via adb Dont worry itll be given in the macro instructions what to do or a quick Google search will help you out Screenshot attached of how the macro should look like finally3 Using savetuner This is a FOSS app which changes how your batterysaver mode deals with applications You can set extreme savings to default settings in the app I set it to extreme and tweaked the settings a bit screenshot attached to get real time updates from apps but also put them into deep sleep otherwise Now this pairs very well with the macro above as your phone does the extreme saving when its locked The phone also doesnt kill apps in memory and I have retrieved an open YT video hours later at the same point from the recents menu 4 Use 4G I know this might be a deal breaker for some people but for me it works great I get the speeds I want from it the phone doesnt heat up and stays cool I also havent had any drops in signal or inability to receive calls etc Also my location is off mostly and Bluetooth is on most times connected with my watch5 Optional Using A15 beta Things are much much smoother The animations the performance of the phone etc If you do update clear the storage of Device health services app everytime you do it This will reset the adaptive battery and brightness stats For some reason this helps the battery life I also have now playing Ok Google and all the bells and whistles of the Pixel device on6 Debloat your Pixel phone Yes you heard me right Pixel OS is supposed to come with no bloat but it isnt There are codes and processes which are useless running all the time in the backgroundThere is an amazing FOSS app called Canta which helps your debloat your phone It has a tag called recommended which recommends the apps you can debloat They have been tested such that if you remove it nothing breaks It has a description of what the app does if you click on it so you can decide if you want to remove it Ive attached screenshots of the apps I kept on the phone out of the recommended bloat such that you dont lose any features If you accidentally uninstall any app that you want dont worry You can easily reinstall it anytime using the same app I dont use android auto or safety or pixel tips etc so you dont find them in the save list You can decide for yourself with the descriptions7 Use the 20  80 rule I charge my phone almost always in the range for maximum battery life I use battery to check the current battery health even though I doubt the accuracy My last phone Realme I ran it for 6 years with the same battery with this rule8 Using Icebox and disabling background usage Icebox is an app which disables any app that you select when you lock your phone My biggest standby drainers were InstagramSnapchat and Mull  a hardened version of Firefox Mull has been fixed now so Ive added Instagram and Snapchat to Icebox Now this will freeze the app like you disabled it so you wont be able to find in the app drawer when you unlock your phone No worries you can add a shortcut from icebox for any app you freeze so that you can open it after unlocking the screen Ive also disabled background usage for some apps like WhatsApp but this will result in you losing access to microphone if you minimize WhatsApp when during a call9 Things I wish could improve Video calling I do a lot of WhatsApp video calls and this eats battery like crazy I wish Google would improve the optimization of battery on video calls10 If you reached this far heres a BONUS tip If you have rooted your phone the Sultan Kernel for pixel 8 is an amazing option for battery and performance Ive heard reports of less heat battery consumption and snappier performance Hes doing what Google Devs should do and for the benefit of the community So check it out Thanks for listening I hope people can benefit from what I did so that you can enjoy your Pixel device Let me know if you have any questions","2024-06-18 09:58:05"

"Positive","Pixel watch 3 my opinion.Ive been using this watch for a month now and as a tech and sports enthusiast I want to share my opinion on a product that seems to have the potential to bridge the gap between smartwatches and sportwatches I say seems because as Ill explain it has some significant limitations that are hard to overlook for anyone serious about sports Strangely these issues are often not highlighted in other reviewsFor context Ive been using the Pixel Watch 2 for daily activities and a Garmin Forerunner for sports tracking  Smartwatch FeaturesWhen it comes to smartwatch functionality theres not much to criticize Compared to the Pixel Watch 2 the new model offers a larger screen even in the 41mm version which is always easy to read and a muchimproved battery life lasting up to 2 days without issuesAll apps run smoothly allowing you to do practically anything respond to WhatsApp messages handle calls with acceptable volume check emails and monitor health metrics If you own a Pixel phone there are added perks such as synchronization of modes eg rest do not disturb alarms and the ability to control your phones camera with a live preview on the watchSports FeaturesHeres where the problems start Google has heavily promoted its new running and structured training features now natively integrated into the Fitbit app These are essential for those aiming beyond casual jogging However during actual running sessions the watch becomes nearly unusable Instant pace The pace calculation is wildly inaccurate with constant nonsensical fluctuations Alwayson display Not all data updates in realtime Some require manually activating the screen which is frustrating if youve disabled wristraise activation Pace alerts When using structured training the pace alerts often incorrect due to bad calculations can drive you insane Battery life After just 50 minutes of running with GPS tracking and music playback the battery dropped from 80 to 30 This is embarrassingly short for a device meant to support sports activitiesFor strength training the experience isnt much better If you want to follow a routine and track weights and reps youll need a thirdparty app as Fitbit only tracks time and cardio activityOne last note about the Fitbit app while its welldesigned and provides plenty of data its frustrating that sleep tracking only shows a summary unless you subscribe to Fitbit Premium This limitation feels unreasonable  ConclusionIf youre looking for a smartwatch and dont have high expectations for sports tracking the Pixel Watch 3 might currently be the best Android option available However if like me youre seeking a device that can replace a dedicated sportwatch like Garmin youll be disappointed and will likely need to continue using two separate devices","2024-12-05 15:08:50"
"Positive","Why I returned the Pixel 9.I would like to share my experience and thoughts about the Pixel 9 including a comparison with the Galaxy S22I respect that its a good phone which might work great with others so the following are just my personal thoughts and why it didnt work out for me I wanted to replace my Galaxy S22 due to its quite poor battery life and after a lot of research I decided on the Pixel 9 due to its clean Android experience and for what was marketed as a compact AIdriven flagship After spending some time with it I decided to return it for several reasons 1 Camera The Pixel 9s camera can take decent photos but at this price point I expected more versatility I found myself missing the telephoto lens of the S22 which has been included in most flagship phones for years Another important omission is the lack of manual controls its an interesting choice to not allow adjustments for ISO or shutter speed Most phones include a manual mode so this was really disappointingOverall in auto mode I would say the Pixel 9 takes similar photos to the almost 3 generations back S22 about 90 of the time and better ones 10 of the time That would have been fine if it offered manual mode or a telephoto lens to complement its strengths2 Size weight and feel This was the dealbreaker for me Despite being marketed as a compact flagship this phone is anything but compact It feels like a brick in hand with flat thick sides that are made worse by the topheavy design caused by the massive camera bump This is far from a onehand device and coming from a genuinely compact phone in the S22 I couldnt ignore the size differenceWith a case on the phone becomes even more cumbersome On top of that the massive front camera hole is very distracting and I could never quite get used to it Its a shame because aside from these issues the phones design feels nice and premium3 AI The new Tensor chips AI capabilities were heavily promoted but they dont feel groundbreaking I was expecting on device AI with things like Gemini nano but as of now it only runs online Comparing the Pixel 9s AI capabilities to the S22 theres not much to gain For example the eraser tool to remove unwanted objects from photos which I use frequently works similarly on both phones That said I found the screenshots feature really helpful4 Inefficient CPU The efficiency of the Tensor chip was another disappointment Tests show that it consumes a lot more battery than the latest Snapdragon while performing the same tasks which is not good news for the longevity of the battery It feels like a larger battery had to be included to compensate for this inefficiency which contributes to the phones bulkiness However in terms of performance the phone runs smoothly and I didnt encounter any issues with the tasks I use it for5 Other things Even smaller features like the promoted weather app fell short The AI summary feature is a nice touch but the design feels uninspired and bland compared to others like the S22s weather app Overall considering the price of the Pixel 9 and the hardware it offers I dont think it justifies the premium costThe quest for a decent compact flagship continuesI hope the Pixel 10 gets things right with a compact release better hardware and a competitive price","2024-12-25 17:09:27"

"Positive","Pixel 8 Pro review  8 months in.Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here Thought Id share my experience after over 8 months of ownershipP8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release I use it with 5G on screen at full resolution dynamic smooth display refresh rate is on no bluetooth or tethering Brightness left on autoTLDR  Positives  camera quality great design OS with some caveats great screen some caveats too Negatives  everything elseCamera  beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line and this release is no exception Every shot has this mesmerizing Pixel touch and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit Videos are world class too not quite on the level of the iPhone but well get there eventuallyBeautiful and unique design  Its sitting in a clear case and in a sea of generic boring slabs it really stands out and doesnt go unnoticed People often ask me what kind of phone it is most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade nowVery long software support  Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene albeit with the following youll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years so its not really a positiveSleek OS  Android in its purest cleanest form Customization galore However as Ill mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly so I dont know if this count as a positive Gorgeous OLED panel  A truly beautiful display highresolution good brightnessunfortunately plagued by mutiple lags and frame drops in the UI Ill get back to that Now onto the negatives First off we must address the elephant in the room Battery life This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast The opposite of what you want right The 10 minutes top ups to 50 is a concept Google seemingly never heard of You want half a charge  Better sit  wait half an hour Full charge  Go watch a movie  Now the discharge and this is where the real drama clocks in This phone EATS battery ON IDLEOn your average 9 to 5 workday no camera no games just basic apps youll head home with 15 tops Phone dead by 7pm then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule better not be in a hurryNow try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone  A bit of pictures for work at 10am a short 4K video at 1pm a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm Youre now looking at a 4pm shutdownBut lets go real on the camera after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day Starting at 10 am  pictures videos a bit of editing about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each Shutdown at 1PMThe CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING Throw anything heavy at it and youll head home with a dead phone one that died long before your day was over Simple as thatKeep in mind that this is my experience with a 8monthsold device and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software supportNow we need to talk UI and animations because this isnt good either Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness but not here Actually some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz Switching apps isnt 120hz either nor is scrolling A TON of lags and various frame drops resulting in a framerate like 4090hz never stable with the occasional but very rare peak at 120 This isnt TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023 1159 flagship phone from GoogleThis phone FEELS slow and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so InfuriatingOne day I had to handle a coworkers A54 to tweak a few things I was SHOCKED by the smoothness this was indeed true 120hz which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos midranger I understand the need for a dynamic framerate not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasnt what I had in mindFinally the optical underdisplay fingerprint scanner This my friends is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018  One of the first phones with UDFS The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable still is most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device just in case Well this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro and no optical sensor backup in sightSometimes it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact tosuccessfully fail to unlock After it fails 3 times or so it will ask you to enter your password making onehand unlocks a luck job Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI As for faceunlock I know its there but I disabled it because it doesnt work in the dark no IR sensor and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height without having to raise it to my facePixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis And indeed it does look incredibly cool I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone but Id rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159TLDR  Positives  Camera quality great design  Negatives

coming soon Like last year we decided to limit the number of devices for the first build to make things easier for us We like to test every single build before release and as you can imagine doing that for just 3 devices instead of 11 is a lot faster Every CalyxOS developer one of these devices Some have 2 That makes working much easier Not everyone has every other device We figured that itd be easier to start with a few devices fix some bugs and then release it for all Also because of the way things are anything that works on Pixel 6a should be fine for 6 and 6 Pro and so on for the others too We didnt want to release something too buggy  non functional At the same time no matter how much testing we do therell always be something we missed so its better to release it and get some feedback Pixel 6 6 Pro 7 7 Pro 8 8 Pro Fold Tablet Hoping to release test builds in the coming week unless something major comes up Pixel 9 Google released these devices with Android 14 but with an entirely different codebase compared to the rest of the pixels That wouldve entailed porting all of our changes to that codebase and keeping it up to date with the rest We decided to wait for Android 15 instead since we knew that Google would unify the codebases then they typically do that It was also apparent with the build IDs of the betas they released Were hoping to release the first test builds in the coming week unless something unexpected comes up FP5 FP4 Moto G32 G42 G52 Pixel 5 4a 5G 5a Were still evaluating Android 15 for all of these devices Each of them will need a lot of work to get things ported and running Well test all hardware functionality before deciding and post an update once we know more TimelineThe below gives an overview of how the CalyxOS team went about the Android 15 work August This was the initial earliest expected date based on past releases We were waiting for it and also used this opportunity to do some more preparation work A big part of that was going through every major change we made to Android 14 and reorganizing  cleaning them up for easier porting This was done at stagingandroid14rebasehttpsreviewcalyxosorgqbranchstagingandroid14rebase

We began work integrating that right away The final release didnt differ too much from the beta we had based our work on for the Pixels which helped as we didnt have to do too much work to update it We also started work on the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro Fold since that didnt receive the beta release we were using for all other devices October 18 2024 CalyxOS 600 was being prepared for release when at the last moment we noticed an issue We wanted to be sure about it just in case so we decided to move the release by a day The issue was due to the changes Google has introduced for Factory Reset Protection Hardening in Android 15 This article Heres how Android 15 blocks thieves from bypassing factory reset protectionhttpswwwandroidauthoritycomandroid15factoryresetprotectionupgrades3479431 covers it well For CalyxOS since we dont have the proprietary Google code that handles this it meant we couldnt ask users to input their credentials to turn it off It is only an issue if your Pixel was already running Android 15 and you didnt Factory Reset from Settings before installing CalyxOS Regardless we wanted to err on the side of caution We have disabled this for now since its not useful for us right now Will revisit in the future October 19 2024 Noticed an issue with SMS sending due to AOSP not updating apps We found a patch on

"Positive","Some things I dont like about the Pixel Watch 3.I owned Fossil watches for years and loved what now feels like the vintage Android Wear experience they offered I eventually switched to a Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 after the charging ring on my Gen 6 watch broke and Fossil later announced they were pulling out of the smartwatch game I thought going for the first Wear OS 3 watch would give me a similar experience but forgot how much Samsung loves to change for the sake of change and how insistent they are on forcing their own apps onto you including Samsung Pay which isnt compatible with some of the banks I use Ive also briefly used TicWatch Pro 3 and TicWatch Pro 5 over these last few years but have returned them after a while because of problems with the strapsI was excited for the release of the Google Pixel Watch 3 but Im surprised that its been a far from perfect experience I thought other people who are considering a purchase might want to read some of the design decisions taken by Google that have detracted from my enjoyment of the device The demo Pixel watches in stores are all dumbed down watches with a very restricted OS Many of the apps are just preprogrammed videolike sequences that you cant interact with and so the watches dont let you explore any of the menu options in any meaningful way so you cant really explore the watch and see what its going to be like before you spend the money on it Google Fit is now entirely replaced by default by the Fitbit app which in itself isnt a bad thing but the Fitbit app is lacking some configurability options that really would improve quality of life The most glaring of these is the Fitbit app on the watch that when opened greets you with a list of information cards that cannot be changed in any way The fixed order of these is Cardio load Readiness Steps Floors Distance Calories burned Active zone minutes Exercise days Hourly activity Heart rate Resting heart rate Sleep Blood oxygen during sleep Skin temp variation Body responses and Mindfulness There is a settings option in the Fitbit app on the watch  the only option here is to sign out The cards on the Fitbit app for phone can be reordered but only in batches by category Individual cards can be turned on and off in the phone app only The Pixel Watch app for my phone that was used to set up the watch is in perpetual dark mode but the Fitbit app that you will switch to during this setup process still hasnt gained a dark mode and will blind you if you were enjoying the dark mode of the Watch app There are no options to configure heart rate tracking oxygen saturation or any aspect of sleep tracking  these are all on by default and at the level of tracking that Google has deemed These options cannot be turned off at all Im very glad to see some very dataheavy watch faces that can accommodate eight complications much like on the Apple Watch However they are all very monochromatic affairs Colours can be changed but it changes the colour for everything and so even though the quality of the screen is top notch its wasted on these watch faces which end up being a series of hued text on an OLED black background I would like the option here to see some additional colours on the included watch faces  the Apple Watch has a bit of colour in the icons and dials for some of the complications as do several in the Google Play Store Live heart rate data can only be seen from the watch face from a tile or from the card on the home screen of the Fitbit app on the watch after scrolling down most of the way Opening the heart rate info in the Fitbit app  on watch or phone  does not provide any live heart rate information There is still no option to check your oxygen saturation levels ad hoc this only happens during sleep And it happens during sleep whether you want it to or not since there is no option for configuring this The auto display brightness feature is good but in dark environments is too dark even on the highest setting The watch can automatically enter DNDbedtime mode when it detects that youve fallen asleep but again there is no option to configure what this mode actually does so its all or nothing including screen off The option to sync this with your phone existed with previous Pixel watches but is noticeably absent this time round The watchs automatic exercise tracking is a bit of a con It asks you after a minimum period of time has passed if you want to track the activity and no GPS information will be saved prior to this question being asked The time period cant be shortened to less than 10 minutes in the Fitbit app on the phoneIm annoyed by some of the items in this list because they are features that are present on Samsung and TicWatch watches and Im surprised that Google hasnt included them in their flagship device when other manufacturers are able to","2024-09-14 16:23:27"

"Positive","Pixel 9 Pro XL Light review from a long time Apple user .Posted to rgooglepixel too Heres a very light review after 3 days Changed as was bored with IPhones and iOS Been using them constantly since IPhone 3GS Been a good ride Now change has come Havent changed phones since 10 XS Max as Ive been waiting for that damn island to disappear 16 was the straw Also not a fan of apple rebranding everything to their liking apple intelligence and their hypocritical sales policy Youre not a force for good youre just like most companies in it for the money stop pretending Always been in the garden but never ever a fan boy Being a fan boygirl for technology is ridiculous Be a fan of peace politeness and respect and good things like good food good weather good times and  good tech regardless of the brand  Love the box Minimal and eminently recyclable I know it costs them peanuts but still its a gorgeous minimalist eco design Better than the shoeboxes from before All you need I look at and use my phone not the boxcasing If a lack of wall charger or earbuds surprises you nowadays youre in for a hard lifeLighter than my 10 XS Max Most phones probably are nowadays Form reminds me of a cross between iPhone 6 S Plus Max cant remember and iPhone 5 for some reason but they were my personal fave iPhones Definitely a beauty Rocking the silicone google case Simplicity Plus have insurance so not worried about crippling drops Set upmoving across was a breeze Used a cable Took about an hourDont mind redoing all my passwords like keychain or 1 Password Gotta delete a lot So an excuse to spring clean Disappointed with subscription 1Password bought a premium account twice a while ago Bitwarden seems to be working fine Also no heating issues at all Phone temperature stayed ambient like the room Even everyday usage doesnt heat it at all But then I dont game or watch filmsseries on it thats what the Sony UHD and PS5 is for I do watch a few Premier League matches a day though on the weekends Bonus Sony uses Android TV so I can control and talk to my TV What a world we live in Scary And good Keyboard is noiiiice Love the haptic feedback without clicks As I have stubby thumbsfingers like pigs tits typing seems to be pleasurable again Had to retype everything on iPhone although my fault shouldve used swipe to type But the predictive text and auto correct seem supremely better I was getting some crazy nonsensical bullshit recently on the iphone Love the numbers at the top of the keyboard permanently And the very quick acces to multiple punctuation marks The one thing missing from ios is the spacebar to move the cursor anywhere not just one line at a time Still not a massive deal Or even a small one Im sure an app may solve it Like jailbreaking Ill live and learn Usage is easy to get used to Swipe gestures are like ios The universal back is a god send Love the simplicity and logic behind usage Although such in depth settings too And deep search within settings Gobsmacked Battery life has been stellar All day 0700  midnight use with 30 left at night 9 hours screen time And Im constantly playing with it and editing photos Which brings me to the camera One of the main reasons for getting this phone Its amazing Does all I want and the quality is crazy good  The built in ai is mind boggling and fun So easy to use especially with the pixel tips app Macro and astrophotography in one bundle count me in The zoom is excellent especially for a phone Add Me is surprisingly useful and a blast especially when adding 2 of the same person Magic Eraser is also useful bettermore convenient than using another app Also changing backgrounds is astoundingly good Portait is also not too bad when you adjust the blur manually The pan and long exposure is fantastic especially on a phone Havent tried much else such as video No bluetooth problems No connection issues at all One of the best things The monochromenight mode Absolutely love it Like I get a new phone each night And the always on lock screen What have I been doing in life to miss out on these thingsGemini is fun too Better than I thought and it does all my tasks easily includung Hue lights TV disappointing but true prognosis for my teams prospects and even opening and playing a song from Apple Music for the lossless still use wired speakers earbuds Plus quickfire questions to prove my kids wrong and that dad knows all Only things missing the spacebar see above the bottom address bar in Chrome and the tap to scroll up know I can get it with Touch the Notch Really not much at all considering the enjoyment and upgrades it brings Absolutely no regrets at all Love it Managed to get Pixel Screenshots and Pixel Studio working even though I live in France Well done APK mirror and side loading not achievable on iphone unless jail broken which I used to do a bit of to get Android features Maybe because my account was originally set up in the UK and I use US English on the phone Who knows They just work Overall a highly recommend phone coming from a 5 year old iphone But highly recommend just the same Magnificent piece of technology hardware os and cloud

"Positive","Follow up comparing S24 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro Fold.Hi allSome folks had wanted me to post on my thoughts and final decision comparing my S24 Ultra and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold  Heres that post httpswwwredditcomrpixelphonescomments1eyplqmboughtmyparentspixel9sthewifea9proandhttpswwwredditcomrpixelphonescomments1eyplqmboughtmyparentspixel9sthewifea9proandMy decision after a little less than a day of use Im keeping the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and will be selling my S24 UltraHere are the main points and reasons why Im going 9 Pro Fold Cameras This is the biggest category to me and I thoroughly enjoy having flagship cameras and never really thinking about whether or not Im getting the best in photography from a mobile device in auto mode  I dont shoot in RAW or Pro modes 99 of the time so thats not a huge consideration for me though both have those options if you need it Googles camera app is simply superior in showing the information you need has less lag and I like their post processing color science compared to Samsungs  I was shocked that standard shooting wide angle and tele photos up to about 10x were very comparable and like I said I like Googles post processing better  I think this is going to be a contentious take but the 9 Pro Folds Cameras met and sometimes what I was hoping to get I dont shoot a lot of video but it shoots 1080p and 4K footage pretty well to boot Feel I cannot stand the sharp corners of the S24 Ultra and really miss my S21 Ultra for its in hand feel  I have a case for the S24 Ultra that makes it more bearable but I prefer to be happy with the feel  The 9 Pro Fold has rounded corners on the right side while closed  hold it there mostly and rounded on all corners when unfolded  Ive been using the phone opened around 80 of the time so this is a major win in my opinion THE INNER SCREEN Yall have used foldables seen countless videos and know what a bigger screen means It has been an absolute delight using a massive screen to browse the web reddit use chat apps and keep a floating YouTube window  without feeling like Im losing out in much in those apps  Split screening apps work very well generally too  Its got vivid colors quick to respond and the S24 Ultra doesnt have one of these Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 vs Tensor G4 I dont do heavy gaming and generally do low key gaming when I do check out httpswwwkingdomrushcomhttpswwwkingdomrushcom best tower defense games ever IMO so thats not a big consideration for me  Day to day use is showing that the G4 performs just fine and seems to be as smooth as my S24 Ultra in everything I do  Its honestly slightly less buggy feeling since there arent duplicate servicesapps needed for every dang thing many of which I opted out of and used Googles versions anyway on the S24 Ultra so another thing for the 9 Pro Fold If you game on mobile heavily you may want to try one out or watch reviews that do proper gaming testing seems to be alright though Flavor of Android building on what I said in the last bullet point I prefer Googles twists on its own OS vs what Samsung does almost all of the time No app redundancies significantly less overhead on the system in apps that run in the background INSANELY fast shut downboot up times on the 9 Pro Fold etc  Many of you have been in both ecosystems and you may prefer one over the other but I think most want the Samsung hardware with Googles flavor of Android Screens in the sun Im going to have to test this but I dont think the 9 Pro Fold not having the anti reflective coating that the S24 Ultra has will be the end of the world  Ive enjoyed being able to see my phone without issue in the sun on the S24 Ultra but I also dont use my phone for more than a moment or two in the bright sun  I dont think I can personally let this be the reason why I dont keep the 9 Pro Fold The 9 Pro Folds screens get wicked bright so Im guessing thatll be enough to quell this loss Charging and battery I charge my phone throughout the day due to working in IT and having some desk time here and there  I also place it on a slow wireless charger at night  I dont get people that can 1 run a modern phone empty and 2 arent aware of small portable battery chargers or 3 able to carry a charger if theyre really beating their phones down to single digit percentages I think most scenarios I see are just irresponsible people so IMO figure that out Wired charging worked very well and was at 20w basically until 80 then went to around 1015w then out every battery does this The phone seems to last and last though and I have been doing a mix of video watching web browsing using apps like Reddit and other chat apps It seems to have really great battery life generally As long as you sleep and can plug it in I dont foresee this being a problem for a majority of people Weight It weighs something like 25g more than the S24 ultra aka peanuts  I barely notice it and the only reason I do is that with a

"Positive","From iPhone to pixel my twoweek notes.I see a lot of posts here asking about going from iPhone to pixel so i write this post to hopefully help someone out About three weeks ago i felt bored of iOS and wanted to try something new First i picked up a used Samsung S20 FE but felt that was too big for me A few days later i then found the Pixel 7A on sale for an acceptable price This was the same day i went for easter holiday which meant i had a whole week with little distractions to get to know pixel and android Turns out i liked it very much My plan was always to use the pixel as a second personal phone with a data sim in addition to my iPhone that work pays for But i decided to try to use it as my daily driver with my main sim for a while The phone is fast with no lag anywhere i could find all apps i use daily was present and looked mostly the same i was also impressed with the camera it took great pictures in every situation except a sunset over the city here it struggled to choose what to prioritize and the result wasnt very good I also like that there seem to be an app for just about everything you can think of thanks to the openness of android And also Emulators for old consoles D  Moving from iPhone to android was relatively painless I opted to not use any transfer assistants and instead start with a blank slate with only the apps i need In day to day use it worked very well except for the bullet points listed at the end  The biggest annoyance is moving passwords If you use iCloud passwords like me its not possible to transfer that to google passwords or a password manager if you dont use a mac Instead you have to copy them one by one The positive is that if you opt for a 3rd party password manager the passwords will then be available on every device you ownOne other important thing to note is that there is apparently no good way to get iCloud calendar and reminders to sync with android This complicated things for me since i use these with my partner to plan our days and shopping if anyone has any tips here please let me knowHaving to buy apps and subscriptions again is also something to consider if you have invested a lot of money into the iOS system My biggest takeaways Positive  Good interface more fun than i expected to customize icons and look of the system I love the gestures Especially the ability to swipe back from the side of the screen this is something i will miss on my iPhone The ability to increase resolution to see more on the screen at the same time this makes the screen feel biggerNegative The keyboard is really inaccurate at least for my typing style it entered frequent spaces while typing and i just ended up with some annoying results I hope the keyboard is adaptive and i feel it might have gotten a little better after a while again if anyone has any tips they are welcome Android auto was slow and laggy I frequently experienced lag and slowness when changing songs in YouTube music and entering addresses in google maps a quick google says Im not alone in experiencing this so hopefully it gets fixed  Not a big issue It takes more work than it should be to change screen brightness and the auto brightness does not work well at allYesterday i put my SIM back in my iPhone mostly because of the top two negative points the issue with icloud sync and that many apps i use frequently only wants to be logged in to one device simultaneously The pixel will now be kept and used for its intended purpose as a secondarypersonal phone I have no issues recommending it and when my job pays for a new phone in October i will now also consider a flagship Android Hopefully they have added pixels to their list of approved phones so i can check out the pixel 9 pro dont really like the look of the Samsung UI","2024-04-08 07:28:11"

"Positive","My Pixel Watch vs Garmin Venu 3 Experience.I got my Pixel Watch 2 with my 8 Pro when it first came out I switched to S24 Ultra this year best decision ever restored my faith in Android after switching from iPhone but Ive kept using my PW2 Recently I purchased Garmin Venu 3 because 1 I felt I never used any of the smartwatch features 2 For some odd reason PW does not support DnDsleep mode sync with any phones other than pixel phones 3 Short battery life At first I was very happy with the purchase and thought Id make the switch but when I saw the release and features of PW3 I decided to return the Garmin It is not because Garmin is a bad watch but PW 3 seems to fit my use case betterPros of the Garmin watch1 Fitnesssports focused If you take fitnesssports seriously especially running then you want to get a Garmin watch 100 There are plenty of reviews that show why Garmin is superior in every aspect in this regard2 Bigger screen I never had any issues with my PW2 screen size and never considered getting a larger watch  until I got the Garmin 45mm After using it I realized having a bigger screen is actually crucial for effectively using a smartwatch It is much better for viewing notifications at a glance using the apps and viewing any information in general I think the small screen of PW2 is the main reason why I used it so little3 Battery life The Garmin watch lasts about a week with the default settings Not having to think about charging two devices that you carry every day can be liberating4 Certain user experience This is the most baffling part of the PW2 Garmin a sportshardware focused company somehow provides better user experience than Google a softwaretech company  in certain areas For example as I stated before you cannot sync DnD between PW and your notpixel android phones PW also doesnt provide the functionality to set DnD schedule I cannot fathom how they think it is not a crucial feature for a smartwatch that every other brand has Garmin also shows your sleep stats and body battery score readiness score equivalent on your watch when you wake up In contrast with Pixel I have to first disable sleep mode otherwise it wont sync with the phone open the Fitbit app sync and then view my sleep statsreadiness score It is also easierquicker to startcontrol workouts with the Garmin Thankfully it appears that they finally provide some important QoL updates on the PW3 I especially think the auto DnD when you are asleep is a musthave feature for every smartwatch5 Body battery score Fitbit has a readiness score but it is nowhere as integrated and utilized as Garmins score Garmin provides tips and suggestion for your day and workout based on your score which is also shown directly on your watch Theres also sleep coaching that helps you to sleep better In this sense the Garmin watch feels smarter than the PW because it provides tips and guidance to you throughout the day at the right time whereas my experience with the PW is it is just a device that records your stats that you can view in the appNow aspects of Garmin that do not align with my use case that well1 Wallet feature This is probably the only smartwatch feature I frequently use However Garmin does not support Google wallet  as it is not a watchOS watch They still have Garmin Pay but it is a separate payment system that is not synced with your phone So you need to readd all your cards and tickets and passes in your Google Wallet wont be available on your watch Im also less confident on the availability of Garmin Pay2 Sleep tracking Garmin does a good enough job But after multiple sidebyside comparisons it seems to be less precise I also compared my Apple Watch 8 with my Garmin This is another confusing part according to The Quantified Scientist Apple Watch has the best sleep tracking and PW2 is close in the second But in my experience Apple Watchs builtin sleep tracking seems to be the worst It seems to heavily rely on the sleep schedule you set which unfortunately Im not following It way overestimates how much I sleep Even thirdparty iOS apps shows me results that are closer to reality Basically for my sleep tracking I rank PW2  Garmin  iPhone thirdparty apps  iPhone builtin tracking3 Smart features Unlike Garmins hardcore sport watches the Venu 3 is advertised as a lifestyle smartwatch so it is closer to a traditional smartwatch than a sport watch It is not as integrated with your phone as the other smartwatches which can be both a pro and a con You can use the Garmin with any phones you own and it functions more independently For some people it is exactly what they need For me I bring my phone with me all the times and Id prefer a bit more smart features and integration with my phone  Finally the price The Venu 3 costs 442 without discounted during Prime Day there was a big discount PW3 does not have that much of an advantage because it cost 400 Garmin will definitely retain its value better And all of Garmins current features do not require a subscription whereas you need Fitbit premium to access all features However if I trade in my PW2 it brings down the price by 220 which is a huge advantage Also considering the improvements of the PW3 seem to be the exact ones that PW2 needs I decided to stick with PW instead Hopefully 3 does not disappoint","2024-08-18 21:59:18"

"Positive"," Some things I dont like about the Pixel Watch 3 .I owned Fossil watches for years and loved what now feels like the vintage Android Wear experience they offered I eventually switched to a Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 after the charging ring on my Gen 6 watch broke and Fossil later announced they were pulling out of the smartwatch game I thought going for the first Wear OS 3 watch would give me a similar experience but forgot how much Samsung loves to change for the sake of change and how insistent they are on forcing their own apps onto you including Samsung Pay which isnt compatible with some of the banks I use Ive also briefly used TicWatch Pro 3 and TicWatch Pro 5 over these last few years but have returned them after a while because of problems with the strapsI was excited for the release of the Google Pixel Watch 3 but Im surprised that its been a far from perfect experience I thought other people who are considering a purchase might want to read some of the design decisions taken by Google that have detracted from my enjoyment of the device The demo Pixel watches in stores are all dumbed down watches with a very restricted OS Many of the apps are just preprogrammed videolike sequences that you cant interact with and so the watches dont let you explore any of the menu options in any meaningful way so you cant really explore the watch and see what its going to be like before you spend the money on it Google Fit is now entirely replaced by default by the Fitbit app which in itself isnt a bad thing but the Fitbit app is lacking some configurability options that really would improve quality of life The most glaring of these is the Fitbit app on the watch that when opened greets you with a list of information cards that cannot be changed in any way The fixed order of these is Cardio load Readiness Steps Floors Distance Calories burned Active zone minutes Exercise days Hourly activity Heart rate Resting heart rate Sleep Blood oxygen during sleep Skin temp variation Body responses and Mindfulness There is a settings option in the Fitbit app on the watch  the only option here is to sign out The cards on the Fitbit app for phone can be reordered but only in batches by category Individual cards can be turned on and off in the phone app only The Pixel Watch app for my phone that was used to set up the watch is in perpetual dark mode but the Fitbit app that you will switch to during this setup process still hasnt gained a dark mode and will blind you if you were enjoying the dark mode of the Watch app There are no options to configure heart rate tracking oxygen saturation or any aspect of sleep tracking  these are all on by default and at the level of tracking that Google has deemed These options cannot be turned off at all Im very glad to see some very dataheavy watch faces that can accommodate eight complications much like on the Apple Watch However they are all very monochromatic affairs Colours can be changed but it changes the colour for everything and so even though the quality of the screen is top notch its wasted on these watch faces which end up being a series of hued text on an OLED black background I would like the option here to see some additional colours on the included watch faces  the Apple Watch has a bit of colour in the icons and dials for some of the complications as do several in the Google Play Store Live heart rate data can only be seen from the watch face from a tile or from the card on the home screen of the Fitbit app on the watch after scrolling down most of the way Opening the heart rate info in the Fitbit app  on watch or phone  does not provide any live heart rate information There is still no option to check your oxygen saturation levels ad hoc this only happens during sleep And it happens during sleep whether you want it to or not since there is no option for configuring this The auto display brightness feature is good but in dark environments is too dark even on the highest setting The watch can automatically enter DNDbedtime mode when it detects that youve fallen asleep but again there is no option to configure what this mode actually does so its all or nothing including screen off The option to sync this with your phone existed with previous Pixel watches but is noticeably absent this time round The watchs automatic exercise tracking is a bit of a con It asks you after a minimum period of time has passed if you want to track the activity and no GPS information will be saved prior to this question being asked The time period cant be shortened to less than 10 minutes in the Fitbit app on the phoneIm annoyed by some of the items in this list because they are features that are present on Samsung and TicWatch watches and Im surprised that Google hasnt included them in their flagship device when other manufacturers are able to","2024-09-14 16:26:37"

"Positive","IPhone 13 PM to Google Pixel Pro 9 XL after one week .Currently been using the Pixel Pro 9 for a week after having been in IOS for 10 years iPhone 13PM This would be the most basic review and all comparisonsthings said are just my opinions The phone is greatly designed The circular camera at the front is noticable but only bc Im used to the 13PMs bezzle The back camera bump is unique and different I feel refreshing to see another design besides Apples and Samsungs I am rocking the 9 Pro XL in hazel and i really dig the color Saw obsidian at my local best buy but hazel was different and subtle The phones build is in my opinion the best looking pixel that looks and feels premium But that can also be just bc of its resemblance to the iPhone that have been looking at for the past 10yearsScreen looks slower and not as fluid as my 13PM It wouldnt be a big deal to me if this phone wasnt 3 years newer than my 13PM so it kinda rubs me the wrong way knowing that the screen on my 13 PM is as good as the Pixel pro 9 Auto dimmer can make the screen a bit too dark for me at times But that is a whole other issueModem is alright I work in a building with 4 floors and Im in the 3rd Calls and messages are great Social media and Internet usage can be a bit delayed Alot of people say that its a big upgrade but I feel that my iPhone was able to get me signal from most places including my 3rd floor office Watching videos on social media lags out a bit at times Idk if its a user error but when on X and watching videos they lag or just stop I have to press play and the video plays for 12 seconds then stops again I just close the app I havent tried looking for a real solution bc frankly I can careless Battery life i am still determining just bc I have had the phone for a week so it is still adjusting to my habits and battery usage But for the first weeks its been alright Im a dad I start my day at 430 am and end it around 910 pm From 430 to 7am Im getting up and going to the gym by 7am my phone was at 90 starting from a full charge By 1 pm my phone is at 55 with just using it for texting my wife light scrolling and playing musicpodcasts in the background So compared to my 13 PM the battery has been weaker But like I said Pixel is still adjusting to my battery usage Camera is alright Some pictures look better and others look better on the 13PM Various of the new upgrades that are AI based are in early stages Doesnt really catch my attention and due to them being early stage roll outs they dont make it into a considerations of an upgrade Magic eraser isnt new but it works alright Pixel studio is cool and I get the idea but it seems like iOS will be having somethings similar Video is def better on the 13PM Just cant argue that one lol camera is good pretty good overall  especially if your camera isnt the buying point Android software is cool very customizable and open to work with Def better than IOSProbably a bunch of other things I havent mentioned but its just a small glimpse to the phoneOverall I think its a great phone but IDK if its worth upgrading FOR ME just bc I dont feel like most of the upgrades are not really full on upgrades","2024-08-29 06:15:26"
