sensorFew days ago I found the phone has no display but the connected BT earbuds still playing musicSo I figured its not deadbut I cant get the screen on no matter what even  restarting by HWLater I

with almost everything with the phone However I cant for the life of me get used to the way the swiping gesture from the right side of the phone  is the same go back action as swiping from the left
