connect our Pixel phones to a TV via USBC to HDMI to get an Android TVlike experience similar to how Android Auto works with car displays It seems like a convenient way to use our phones as a media center without needing a separate deviceDoes anyone know if there are technical limitations or other reasons why this isnt available Would love to hear your thoughts and insights on thisPSJust imagine the possibility of our used old phones as Android TV Do you think Chromecast is as powerful as our phones ","96":"Pixel 6 Pro  People cant hear me anymore since Android 15 update.Hello

Everything worked exactly as intended Of course its a bit awkward on a mobile phone keyboard but I believe this is a step for google towards a DesktopAndroid where you can connect an Android phone to a monitor and it automatically switches","98":"After several months I now hate the Pixel Fold.To keep it short a crack has formed on the inner screen despite me barely using itThe touch on the external screen is nowhere near as accurate as it used to beAndroid Auto works about 60 of the timeAnd as of late its crashing randomlyAnd with the whole If you send your device to us for repair and you used aftermarket parts well keep it thing going on now I think Ill be switching away from Google phones after this oneJust seems like it was designed more for showing a crowd rather than regular useThats all just came to rant about all the issues Ive had with this phone  Feel free to share your experience with the Fold in the comments  Misery loves company after all","99":"Pixel 8a and Subaru

Pro XL or S24 Ultra.Coming from a Pixel 6 Pro which to be fair has been pretty great I mostly use my phone for Android Auto in the car and playing videos while Im doing something some camera usage although not as much as when my kids were younger And of course the usual web browsingemailTEAMS for workbankingetc Not really a power user or mobile gamer So with all that said youd think Pixel 9 Pro XL is a no brainer I do like the bare Android experience But I have a hard time getting over the substantial difference in power and how that will age Will the Pixel be a dog in 25 years because the processor is slow And I dont love that Google is starting to hide their AI features behind a paywall that I will never pay for Thats the whole point of the Tensor processor noAnyways looking for suggestions from anybody who has spent time with both","101":"Android AutoGoogle Assistant woes with new pixel.Hi allApologies if this has been asked before however I just moved from iOS to Android Pixel 9 Pro I am having some issues with Google Assistant within Android AutoWhen I ask Google Assistant something the response is compressedmuffled Kinda like the quality of a phone call if that

call recording solution.Hi Guys from quite some time was checking on price drop for P8P and seems deals might come in soon But i noticed one thing that pixel phones dont allow call recording On further check seems its Android call and many phones are now showing this behaviour though allowing it to some extent with some message or sound But Pixels seems restrictive and I check a 6a as well which has no call recording optionIs there a solution for this not root Also dont prefer loudspeaker mic recording options","104":"My Recent Frustrations with Google Pixel 9 Convince me Not to go Back to iPhone.I recently upgraded from an iPhone 12 Pro to a Google Pixel 9 I am liking it so far but I have several frustrations with it bearaly enough to almost break the camels back and go back to iPhone I was wondering if anyone can give me advice or thoughts 1 Battery is not as expected I was expecting to get about 13 hours on onscreen battery life but I am not getting close to that I am getting around 8 hours I recently found the issue or what I think the issue is at least After I use android auto it keeps running in the background all day and drains all of my battery2 When using Spotify to listen to podcasts every time a notification comes in it pauses the podcast plays the notification sound and 75 of the time it resumes the podcast The other 25 of the time it will remain paused for no reason 25 Sometimes the podcast will pause altogether on its own and then I have to press play to resume 3 When using Android Auto WhatsApp voice messages will not play The music volume will lower but the messages will not play 4 Whatsapp does not ring on Android Auto only on the phone so there is no Whatsapp interface on AA 5 On the contrary there is no phone call interface on the phone when youre talking through a regular phone call on Android Auto it only shows in your cars screen Which means that you cannot activate a feature like Call Notes while driving 6 Aggregation of health app data on iPhone all health app data would aggregate on Apple Health and every app would have every other apps data The equivalent on Android health connect is simply not good I use FitBod for strength training and MyNetDiary for calorie tracking On iPhone calories would automatically be aggregated through apple health and would automatically reflect on MyNetDiary but it is failing to do so using Health Connect It shows up as a workout on MyNetDiary but none of the important information like calories aggregates correctly so I must input it manually  Does anyone have any solution to these or can share their thoughts I really really want to stay on Pixel Android forever so I hope I can get at least some of these things fixed so that I dont have to go back ","105":"Poll result The
