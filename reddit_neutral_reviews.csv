"Neutral","Pixel 7 pro light sensor got problem.Theres a problem on my pixel 7 pros light sensorFew days ago I found the phone has no display but the connected BT earbuds still playing musicSo I figured its not deadbut I cant get the screen on no matter what even  restarting by HWLater I found if I hold it in my hand for a while if it warmer enough it will turn on againBut if I put it in pocket afterwards it wont turn on againAfter some experiments I concluded that its light sensor issue with cold temperatureThis issue may caused by the phone fall off few timesI switched to developer mode and turn off sensors It works at beginning but symptom gets worse sometimes it will turn off even with the sensors turn offI opened the case try to repair it but find no misplaced parts"

"Neutral","Switched from iPhone after 10 years in ecosystem to Google Pixel and getting a bit frustrated.Im in love with almost everything with the phone However I cant for the life of me get used to the way the swiping gesture from the right side of the phone  is the same go back action as swiping from the left sideI understand that you can click where you originally clicked to go back to the page but for some reason it just seems counterintuitive to me for the two opposing gestures to perform the same actionIll be in a reddit post swipe back but then want to return to the post I was on But nope it continues backward in my click history Anyone else get annoyed by this"
