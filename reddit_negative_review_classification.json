The issue has been reported on Reddit, PhoneArena, and Android Police, but no official response has been given by Google.\n\nThe problem seems to be device-specific, affecting Pixel users more frequently than other smartphone brands like iPhone or Samsung. Despite this being anecdotal evidence, some common factors can be observed:\n\n1. The issue persists across multiple countries and continents, making it unlikely that the 2G\/3G phaseout is the cause.\n2. Users have reported successfully making regular calls in the same place right before or after failing to reach emergency services.\n3. Family members on the same plan can dial 911 from the same location without issue, suggesting that the problem isn't carrier-specific.\n4. Although some reports may be due to poor signal areas, many verify their software was up to date and have ruled out this possibility.\n5. This issue represents phones unintentionally contacting emergency services rather than being unable to in an emergency situation.\n6. While the extent of the issue is unknown, it's important to note that even a small percentage of Pixel users experiencing this problem could indicate a significant issue for the overall user base.\n7. The OP of the first report has reliably reproduced the issue from their home, which supports the idea that there is an issue specifically with Pixels.\n\nFor those who are concerned about their safety and the functionality of their Google Pixel devices, it may be wise to consider alternative smartphone options until the issue is resolved or acknowledged by Google.",
        "user_review":"I compiled all the Pixel 911emergency call failures I could find in 2022 its a lot I couldnt find any for iPhoneGalaxy.2023 Update  I have continued to update this post and we are now into 2023 and already seeing reports of Pixel 7s failing to reach 911emergency services It would be really great if we could get some acknowledgement from Google uPixelCommunity OverviewMany of you have probably seen some of the recent posts about Pixels failing to connect to emergency services I noticed that each one of these posts would also bring replies from other people with the same issue but many of these commenters never made standalone posts So I decided to compile a list of all of the unique reports I could find for 2022 only for visibility In summary Below are are 20 reports of emergency call failures some links involve multiple failuresmultiple phones from Pixel users this year alone including from the past weekhttpswwwredditcomrGooglePixelcommentsxwjnf2pixel6profailedtoconnectto911lastweek Ive left out the numerous reports from before 2022 in case they were related to the Teamsalternate dialer bug which was supposed to have been patched in January Not a single word that Im aware of from Google on this Google did quickly fix a similar issue affecting a single carrier in Japan but that is clearly unrelated to this widespread issue Very similar versions of this issue have been reported in the US Spain and Australia among other countries What about iPhoneSamsungetcIts difficult to know for certain as we have to rely on individual reports online or company PR but I havent been able to find a single report  on Reddit or elsewhere of an iPhone or another major Android brand having this issue within the last few years If you can find any such reports please let me know and I will update this post     So far commenters have pointed out a handful links to iPhone failures one in 2018 one in 2014 and one in 2008 Still looking for more recentwidespread reports Apple and Samsung both sell 1020x the number of phones Google does sourcehttpswwwandroidpolicecomgooglenearlyquadruplesmarketshare3percent so it is very surprising that Pixel emergency failure reports are so numerous and easy to find while there dont seem to be any for these other phones One notable feature of many of the reports below is that people were able to dial 911 with their work phonespartners other brand phonesother bystanders phones which to me suggests that these issues werent caused by local 911 outages The List  Pixel Emergency Failure Reports in 2022So here are the reports Ive been able to find for Pixels in 2022 in one afternoon of

routinghttpswwwredditcomrGooglePixelcommentsw1wcrb911callissueonpixel56nodialpadavailableApologies if Ive accidentally included any duplicates  there are a few cases where the same person shares their story in multiple threads and I may have missed it ConclusionFor me personally my partner and I have pretty much resigned ourselves to leaving Pixel for now I am a diehard Pixel fan and love everything about the experience I even have a 7 7 Pro and 2 watches on preorder  too late to cancel now so Ill have to return but I just dont feel okay gambling my life or my partners with this issueIve been happy to see that in the past few days some tech news sites PhoneArenahttpswwwphonearenacomnewspixel911emergencycallsbugid143002 and AndroidPolicehttpswwwandroidpolicecomgooglepixelphonesstrugglingtoreachemergency have posted articles about this issue but I havent yet seen another exhaustive compilation and of course still no word from Google on thisEdit  I foolishly stuck with Pixels and weve been happily using our 77 Pro and Pixel Watches but now reports have started to roll in of Pixel 7s having the same emergency calling issues here we go again Or maybe I shouldnt say again because the 6 continues to have this issueIf you know of another report or if this has happened to you please comment and I will add to the list EDIT FAQsIve noticed some common questionscomments come up in the replies many of which are addressed in the linked posts or comments by the original posters To save people from having to read through all of the accountsdig through comment history Im going to compile some of these here1 Could these be people who never updated after the 911 bug Google fixed in January     Its possible that a few of the earlier reports in this list are caused by that but some of the later reports specifically verifiedhttpswwwredditcomrGooglePixelcommentsxwjnf2commentir9v1diutmsourceshareutmmediumweb2xcontext3 that their software was up to date      I specifically excluded any reports from early January 2022 or before to reduce the likelihood that that bug was involved2 Could these reports just be due to being in areas with poor signal     Many of the reports see the 1st and 3rd for examples mention other facts that preclude this possibility          Successfully making regular calls in the same place right beforeafter         Family members on the same plan successfully dialing 911 from the same location         Their phones showing full signal3 Could this be related to 2G3G phaseout     I am not knowledgeable about this but I have a few thoughts First the issue has happened in multiple countries which does make me think this is unlikely Second even if it were related why hasnt this affected other phones If this were the case it doesnt excuse Google as clearly other manufacturers had no problems4 What about the iPhone rollercoaster 911 calls     The major difference there is that this represents a phone unintentionally contacting emergency services rather than being unable to in the midst of an emergency5 Is this a carrierspecific issue     Right off the bat the existence of this issue in multiple countriescontinents suggests that this is not the case However even within the US reports there are multiple carriers mentioned definitely Fi and Verizon possibly others6 Isnt this just anecdotal     Yes so of course we dont know the full extent of the issue but if we apply some basic reasoning we notice a few important features of this issue         There are numerous anecdotes of Pixels specifically failing in 2022         There are currently zero anecdotes of iPhones or Samsungs failing in the past 4 years let alone in 2022         iPhones and Samsungs both sell 1020 times the numbers that Pixels do         Even if you assumed that every member of rGooglePixel was a current Pixel owner 890k members this represents only 25 of Pixel owners in the wild Even if having a 911 issue might make a user more likely to join Reddit and post here it is very unlikely that all or even most people who experience such an issue would happen to come to Reddit or post on supportgooglecom         The OP of the 1st report has a video on her instagram of her reproducing the issue reliably days later from her home     While these facts dont prove anything by far the simplest possible explanation is that         There is an issue specifically with Pixels         Statistically it is likely that only a small percentage of people with the issue have reported it in a public forum meaning that it is overwhelmingly likely that this issue affects more people than have reported it hereEdit thank you anonymous stranger for the award"

        "user_review":"Long Post Ahead  My Honest and Complete Experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL as a Longtime iPhone User.Hey everyone I wanted to share my full and honest experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL This might be a long post but I hope it gives valuable insight especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S This is my very first experience with a Pixel and Android in general Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XLI usually upgrade my phone every two years but this year the iPhone 16 Pro Max didnt feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Maxat least not enough to justify the cost So I decided to finally give Android a shot and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience the Pixel lineup Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel The CameraIm a professional photographer and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use This time I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my goto mobile photography device Unfortunately Ive been quite disappointed due to several software restrictionsespecially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app Ive made a separate post about this issue Software Experience Just Good But Not ExceptionalThe Android experience on the Pixel is fineit gets the job done But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily lifeSome features I really liked The ability to longpress the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen The automatic song recognition feature which detects music playing around me Gemini AI is promising but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands Fingerprint and Face Unlock Fingerprint Sensor Excellent Works fast and reliably with no issues Face Unlock Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead I dont have anything covering the camera or affecting it yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful Camera My Biggest DisappointmentDespite the Pixels strong reputation for mobile photography my experience has been frustrating The camera is great only in excellent lighting conditions and mainly for still photos Issues I Faced1 Excessive smoothing and processing  Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing even in RAW When I open RAW files in Lightroom they appear overly soft and lose critical details2 Depth of field issues  The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus and even AI adjustments cant fully correct it3 Limitations on thirdparty apps  8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app Thirdparty apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos which is frustrating for professional use4 Lens switching in video mode is terrible  When switching between lenses while recording theres an obvious cut and disruption making transitions very unprofessional The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality5 Auto white balance is unreliable  It constantly shifts in realtime while recording forcing me to set it manually every time6 Portrait mode looks artificial  The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural7 Lowlight performance is extremely poor  Even with Night Sight the results are disappointing If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode the results improve slightly but they are still far from what I expectedMost of these issues werent present on my iPhone even though Ive gone through every setting and tried full manual controls No matter what I change the postprocessing ruins my shots This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone App Store  Software EcosystemI also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple In theory Android apps should be cheaper not more expensive Additionally app quality feels more inconsistentmany apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily UseI want to be clear Im not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel In fact I want to switch and Ive been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone But after three months of daily use the experience hasnt lived up to my expectationsIm genuinely wondering Am I missing something Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues Is there any way to improve the bad image processing Has anyone found a fix for thirdparty camera limitationsI always keep my software and apps updated but nothing has improved these issues so far Id love to hear your thoughts and inputespecially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel Is there something Im overlookingEdit 1  More context I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the\u00a0Pixel 9 Pro XL specifically regarding\u00a0RAW photo processingIve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in\u00a0Lightroomthey look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos Theres a\u00a0huge loss of detail aggressive noise reduction and softening making the RAW files almost unusable for proper editingIve attached\u00a0two images of the same RAW file\u00a0to show what I mean\u00a0Comparison Images  httpsimgurcomaBdOOOtyhttpsimgurcomaBdOOOty1\u00a0First image\u00a0 RAW viewed in Google Photos looks relatively fine  2\u00a0Second image\u00a0 The exact same RAW file opened in Lightroom before any edits The Issue When opening the RAW file in\u00a0Lightroom it looks\u00a0significantly worse with\u00a0excessive smoothing and loss of sharpness This happens\u00a0before applying any adjustments so its not an issue with my editing It feels like\u00a0Google is still applying some kind of processing or compression to RAW files which defeats the purpose of shooting RAW in the first place Questions Is this a known issue with Pixel RAW processing Is there a way to get true unprocessed RAW files for editing Anyone else experiencing this with Lightroom or other editing appsId really appreciate any input from other Pixel users especially photographers I want to get the most out of this camera but this has been a frustrating limitation Let me know if you have any insights  "
