"Negative","Why is Pixel Watch trying to be a phone And pretty much any other modern smart watches out there.Context  Ive been a Pebble  Fitbit user for over 10 years I reluctantly switched to a Google Pixel Watch 3 because my Fitbit Sense 2 broke and it seemed like a dumb idea to replace it when the company is dead Ive had the Pixel Watch for about a week now and I think it could be so much better if it didnt have all these features that I would just pull out my phone to do anyway The biggest problem I have with this watch is that the damn thing cannot even last 24 hours on a charge half the time When do you guys charge this watch I used to just charge my old smart watches when I showered pretty much everyday and that was enough for them to stay on 247 on my wrist But thats not enough with this watch A 30 min shower  charge doesnt get me anywhere near 100 and the watch dies when its supposed to track my sleep I believe that a consistent 2 days battery life and quick charging capability are essential for a smartwatch because theyre expected to be on all the time for accurate health tracking Why are these not on Googles third iteration of a smartwatch or on most Wear OS smart watches out there Im seriously confused There are only 4 things I want in a watch lmk if yall value other features on Pixel Watch btw Im always looking for new useful features to learn health tracking and emergency features informative widgets  notifications with options to reply back with voice or quick replies apps that try to aid something Im doing irl and keeps me from having to pull my phone out like showing the next direction when Im navigating on Google Maps Its so disappointing to me how much bloat is on here Literally any app on this thing that is not related to health tracking tracking Like Todoist WhatsApp Gmail  are just clones of the phone app equivalent on a watch where you can scroll around around and type things Who uses these Wouldnt you just pull out your phone to do these things Ever since Fitbit got acquired Ive been struggling to understand why these major smartwatches on the market with Wear OS are so bloated with things Id rather do on a phone  that their battery lives are worse than smart watches from 510 years ago Let me know what yall think Am I missing something here ","2024-11-30 14:08:45"

"Negative","Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner  8monthsin review .Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here Thought Id share my experience after almost 8 months of ownershipP8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release I use it with 5G on screen at full resolution dynamic smooth display refresh rate is on no bluetooth or tethering Brightness left on autoTLDR  Positives  Camera quality great design  display OS with some caveats  Negatives  everything elseThe positives Camera  beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line and this release is no exception Every shot has this mesmerizing Pixel touch and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit Videos are world class too not quite on the level of the iPhone but well get there eventuallyBeautiful and unique design  Its sitting in a clear case and in a sea of generic boring slabs it really stands out and doesnt go unnoticed People often ask me what kind of phone it is most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade nowVery long software support  Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene albeit with the following youll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years so its not really a positiveWorld class display  stellar QHD 120hz panel sharp and brightSleek OS  Android in its purest cleanest form Customization galore However as Ill mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly so I dont know if this count as a positive Now onto the negativesFirst off we must address the elephant in the room Battery life This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast The opposite of what you want right The 10 minutes top ups to 50 is a concept Google seemingly never heard ofYou want half a charge  Better sit  wait half an hour Full charge  Go watch a movie  Now the discharge and this is where the real drama clocks in This phone EATS battery ON IDLEOn your average 9 to 5 workday no camera no games just basic apps youll head home with 15 tops Phone dead by 7pm then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule better not be in a hurryNow try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone  A bit of pictures for work at 10am a short 4K video at 1pm a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm Youre now looking at a 4pm shutdownBut lets go real on the camera after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day Starting at 10 am  pictures videos a bit of editing about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each Shutdown at 1PMThe CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING Throw anything heavy at it and youll head home with a dead phone one that died long before your day was over Simple as thatKeep in mind that this is my experience with a 8monthsold device and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software supportNow we need to talk UI and animations because this isnt good either Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness but not here Actually some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz Switching apps isnt 120hz either nor is scrolling A TON of lags and various frame drops resulting in a framerate like 4090hz never stable with the occasional but very rare peak at 120 This isnt TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023 1159 flagship phone from GoogleThis phone FEELS slow and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so InfuriatingOne day I had to handle a coworkers A54 to tweak a few things I was SHOCKED by the smoothness this was indeed true 120hz which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos midranger I understand the need for a dynamic framerate not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasnt what I had in mindFinally the optical underdisplay fingerprint scanner This my friends is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018  One of the first phones with UDFS The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable still is most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device just in case Well this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro and no optical sensor backup in sightSometimes it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact tosuccessfully fail to unlock After it fails 3 times or so it will ask you to enter your password making onehand unlocks a luck job Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI As for faceunlock I know its there but I disabled it because it doesnt work in the dark no IR sensor and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height without having to raise it to my facePixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis And indeed it does look incredibly cool I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone but Id rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159TLDR  Positives  Camera quality great design  Negatives  everything else","2024-05-21 12:02:32"

"Negative","Bought a Pixel Fold and other devices Turned into my worse customer experience ever Google Support is trash and its stressing me out.I wanted to move away from Apple I have all the Apple things and after being with them for years I decided to wholesale move over to Google I liked what they offered with the Fold and the ecosystem around itI ordered a Pixel Fold and a new pair of Buds together The buds werent out yet but I was happy to wait a few weeksI also ordered the new Pixel Watch as a separate order and I ordered a set of bathroom scales Googles Fitbit Aria scalesSo heres the issuesThe phone arrived and its great no complaints however the courier ended up losing the scales Looking at the tracking it looks like they got to my local depot and got lost there I spoke to the courier via their app DPD and they confirmed the items are missing and I should go back to the sender Google I took screenshots of Googles DPD tracking info showing the item was tracked up until my local depot but shows as being held there I took a screenshot of my chat with DPD I put all this together and started a Google Support chat session The advisor said they would have to escalate it and get back to me A few days later I received an email from Google Support saying they can confirm the was delivered to my address I honestly couldnt believe what they were saying here I was shocked I had proof from several sources saying the item was missing Googles own courier claims its missing But Google repeatedly claimed the item was delivered and refused to back up their claim with any proof They closed the caseI stressed this again to Google laying it all out 1 more time with all the screenshots again I said I want a Final Response position from Google here so I can decide if I am going to put together a small claims court Google response that the item has been delivered and this is their final response So I send off a letter to their HQ in London saying outlining everything again and suggesting I will take them to small claims court should they not refund meBut alas there is much moreBy this time I am getting quite frustrated but also wondering where my Pixel Buds are remember I ordered them together with the phone I arranged a finance agreement with Klarna for this so it was all 1 amount but they should be due to arrive any time nowI check the order status and Google had cancelled the Pixel Buds from my original order with no warning prior no notification afterwards or anything I again start a chat session with Google Support and they say that yes they cancelled them I ask why and they claim Because of terms of service I didnt know what this meant so I ask again and they claim that they dont have to give me a reason that they can cancel any part of my order at any time for any reason They suggest that if I want to order some more Pixel Buds then thats my choiceI check with Klarna and they have the full finance agreement in place for both items So I go back and explain that the order was for 2 items but they are not interested at all Now at this point I could probably go back to Klarna let them open an investigation and ultimately after their customary 21 days investigation lead time have the finance agreement amended to not include the Pixel Buds Then I could reorder them again from Google under a fresh finance agreement and another credit check But by now I am pretty pissed off I no longer want to have anything to do with Google and certainly dont want to order more products from themI wanted to make the argument that Google in this instance is in breach of contract My contract with them was for the phone and the buds This was 1 order with 1 order number containing 2 items Google has failed to meet the obligations of this contract and now I want the finance deal cancelled and I can make arrangements to return the phone which at this point was 4 days outside the 14 day refund policy  to me this doesnt matter as they broke the contractTo me having the Buds are an essential component to the order I realise the are a much cheaper part of the total order but it was essential that along with the phone I also got the Buds The way Google sells the integrations between the phone and buds was a key reason for me ordering them togetherI put all this together in an email after speaking to Trading Standards and I basically got a 1 line response along the line of After careful review noSo yet again Ive had to go through the process of a Final Response  answer no And now I am at the state of asking if they are part of an Alternative Dispute Resolution scheme to look at this case Failing that again I will have to open another small claims court caseAnd finally at this point I dont want any Google products I wanted to return my Google Pixel watch which was inside the 14 days so I could click the return button on the website However I cant do this as as soon as I click the refund button I get an error on the page saying I need to contact support I speak to chat yet again and yet again they say they need to escalate the issue 3rd time for 3 cases and I just dont hear back from them after daysTo make matters worse Google refuses to give me any case numbers during the email conversations and they insist that all these separate issues are dealt with via 1 long email chain with the different issues and their replies all mingled togetherThis is the worst experience I have ever had with a company Its just diabolical and they should be ashamed of their behaviorPlease guys dont buy anything from Google again","2024-09-26

mesmerizing Pixel touch and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit Videos are world class too not quite on the level of the iPhone but well get there eventuallyBeautiful and unique design  Its sitting in a clear case and in a sea of generic boring slabs it really stands out and doesnt go unnoticed People often ask me what kind of phone it is most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade nowVery long software support  Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene albeit with the following youll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years so its not really a positiveWorld class display  stellar QHD 120hz panel sharp and brightSleek OS  Android in its purest cleanest form Customization galore However as Ill mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly so I dont know if this count as a positive Now onto the negativesFirst off we must address the elephant in the room Battery life This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast The opposite of what you want right The 10 minutes top ups to 50 is a concept Google seemingly never heard ofYou want half a charge  Better sit  wait half an hour Full charge  Go watch a movie  Now the discharge and this is where the real drama clocks in This phone EATS battery ON IDLEOn your average 9 to 5 workday no camera no games just basic apps youll head home with 15 tops Phone dead by 7pm then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule better not be in a hurryNow try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone  A bit of pictures for work at 10am a short 4K video at 1pm a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm Youre now looking at a 4pm shutdownBut lets go real on the camera after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day Starting at 10 am  pictures videos a bit of editing about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each Shutdown at 1PMThe CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING Throw anything heavy at it and youll head home with a dead phone one that died long before your day was over Simple as thatKeep in mind that this is my experience with a 8monthsold device and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software supportNow we need to talk UI and animations because this isnt good either Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness but not here Actually some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz Switching apps isnt 120hz either nor is scrolling A TON of lags and various frame drops resulting in a framerate like 4090hz never stable with the occasional but very rare peak at 120 This isnt TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023 1159 flagship phone from GoogleThis phone FEELS slow and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so InfuriatingOne day I had to handle a coworkers A54 to tweak a few things I was SHOCKED by the smoothness this was indeed true 120hz which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos midranger I understand the need for a dynamic framerate not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasnt what I had in mindFinally the optical underdisplay fingerprint scanner This my friends is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018  One of the first phones with UDFS The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable still is most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device just in case Well this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro and no optical sensor backup in sightSometimes it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact tosuccessfully fail to unlock After it fails 3 times or so it will ask you to enter your password making onehand unlocks a luck job Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI As for faceunlock I know its there but I disabled it because it doesnt work in the dark no IR sensor and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height without having to raise it to my facePixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis And indeed it does look incredibly cool I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone but Id rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159TLDR  Positives  Camera quality great design  Negatives  everything else","2024-05-21 12:02:32"
"Negative","Long Post Ahead  My Honest and Complete Experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL as a Longtime iPhone User.Hey everyone I wanted to share my full and honest experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL This might be a long post but I hope it gives valuable insight especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S This is my very first experience with a Pixel and Android in general Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XLI usually upgrade my phone every two years but this year the iPhone 16 Pro Max didnt feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Maxat least not enough to justify the cost So I decided to finally give Android a shot and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience the Pixel lineup Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel The CameraIm a professional photographer and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use This time I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my goto mobile photography device Unfortunately Ive been quite disappointed due to several software restrictionsespecially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app Ive made a separate post about this issue Software Experience Just Good But Not ExceptionalThe Android experience on the Pixel is fineit gets the job done But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily lifeSome features I really liked The ability to longpress the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen The automatic song recognition feature which detects music playing around me Gemini AI is promising but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands Fingerprint and Face Unlock Fingerprint Sensor Excellent Works fast and reliably with no issues Face Unlock Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead I dont have anything covering the camera or affecting it yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful Camera My Biggest DisappointmentDespite the Pixels strong reputation for mobile photography my experience has been frustrating The camera is great only in excellent lighting conditions and mainly for still photos Issues I Faced1 Excessive smoothing and processing  Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing even in RAW When I open RAW files in Lightroom they appear overly soft and lose critical details2 Depth of field issues  The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus and even AI adjustments cant fully correct it3 Limitations on thirdparty apps  8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app Thirdparty apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos which is frustrating for professional use4 Lens switching in video mode is terrible  When switching between lenses while recording theres an obvious cut and disruption making transitions very unprofessional The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality5 Auto white balance is unreliable  It constantly shifts in realtime while recording forcing me to set it manually every time6 Portrait mode looks artificial  The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural7 Lowlight performance is extremely poor  Even with Night Sight the results are disappointing If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode the results improve slightly but they are still far from what I expectedMost of these issues werent present on my iPhone even though Ive gone through every setting and tried full manual controls No matter what I change the postprocessing ruins my shots This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone App Store  Software EcosystemI also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple In theory Android apps should be cheaper not more expensive Additionally app quality feels more inconsistentmany apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily UseI want to be clear Im not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel In fact I want to switch and Ive been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone But after three months of daily use the experience hasnt lived up to my expectationsIm genuinely wondering Am I missing something Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues Is there any way to improve the bad image processing Has anyone found a fix for thirdparty camera limitationsI always keep my software and apps updated but nothing has improved these issues so far Id love to hear your thoughts and inputespecially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel Is there something Im overlookingEdit 1  More context I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL specifically regarding RAW photo processingIve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in Lightroomthey look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos Theres a huge loss of detail aggressive noise reduction and softening making the RAW files almost unusable for proper editingIve attached two images of the same RAW file to show what I mean Comparison Images  httpsimgurcomaBdOOOtyhttpsimgurcomaBdOOOty1 First image  RAW viewed in Google Photos looks relatively fine  2 Second image  The exact same RAW file opened in Lightroom before any edits The Issue When opening the RAW file in Lightroom it looks significantly worse with excessive smoothing and loss of sharpness This happens before applying any adjustments so its not an issue with my editing It feels like Google is still applying some kind of processing or compression to RAW files which defeats the purpose of shooting RAW in the first place Questions Is this a known issue with Pixel RAW processing Is there a way to get true unprocessed RAW files for editing Anyone else experiencing this with Lightroom or other editing appsId really appreciate any input from other Pixel users especially photographers I want to get the most out of this camera but this has been a frustrating limitation Let me know if you

"Negative","Using Bluetooth is exhausting on Pixel devices.Long time NexusPixel user Ive never really used Bluetooth devices much until the last few years when I got the OG Pixel buds and then later on the Pixel watch Other than that its usually only for Android AutoAnd ever since Ive been struggling to understand the logic with some of the Bluetooth device behavior when using them with Pixel phones1 When making a call with any Bluetooth device connected It always switches to that device when the other person answers the phoneFor example Ill be making a call with my phone connected to a Bluetooth speaker or Android Auto But I want to use the built in phone ear speaker instead for privacy or whatever So while the phone is ringing I switch to the phone ear speaker but as soon as the other person picks up it would switch back to the Bluetooth deviceThis is completely unrelated to any safety feature for Android Auto which was my initial thought when I didnt have any Bluetooth accessories It happens with my Sony ear buds my Pixel watch my gaming headphones etcIf I switch to a different speaker while making a call I expect it to remain until the call is overIts gotten to the point of me disabling the Pixel watch as a Bluetooth speaker because it makes it worse even when I dont have any other Bluetooth devices connected2 Why do I need 4 actions to disconnect from a device Sometimes more when the phone is locked We need a simple toggle next to all the connected devices in the quick tile menu instead of the gear icon that takes us to the Bluetooth settings pageMy phone is rooted but I cant seem to find any mods to help with these other than flashing a different romIts been a few years now and for simple bugs google sure is taking its sweet time to fix it If anything it seems to be getting worse","2025-03-26 12:30:02"

"Negative","Comparing my new Pixel 9 Pro experience to my old Pixel 8.First Ive been using Pixel phones since the Pixel 3  Still have it and several models in between  Most recently I used the Pixel 8 for a few years  I did have a lot of battery problems and I personally replaced the battery 3 times in it  So my Pixel 8 experience wasnt trouble free  But Im 2 weeks in to using my new Pixel 9 Pro p9p  and I cant say I like it  at all  Im just crossing my fingers that these problems get addressed and refined with updates to Android as I saw similar but smaller scale issues on my Pixel 8 p8 get better and better over time  Curious what all of your experiences with a Pixel 9 compared to older PIxel platforms isproblems Battery capacity SUCKS on p9p charge it in morning by bedtime its at 40  to 50 and then 10 in the morning I have switched graphics resolution to crappy version but really the point to a new phone is its better and I shouldnt have to run it in a hobbled mode to extend the battery a couple of hours P8 I could go 2 full days between charges  same exact application payloads and usage patterns with a screen protector  it is COMPLETELY unusable via the touch input  surface  even after fiddling with the sensitivity settings specifically for screen protectors  I had to rip off my screen protector to even get to the PIN input because fingerprint auth and low light facial both failed Its weirdly slippery  Ive watched my phone literally slide off of surfaces screen side down that had even the tiniest of tilt to it  resolved of course with a properdecent case  but insanely slippery without one Screen responsetouch input is horrible  Sometimes I have to try touching something 2 or 3 times before it responds Finger print reader is absolute crap on p9p  on my p8 it worked perfectly flawlessly for me Text to Speech constantly stops in mid sentence on p9p and I have to restart it to try and finish a simple sentence 2 or 3 times  on p8  it was almost flawless yeah sometimes got words wrong but rarely this is probably not p9p specific  but using an external secretsvault service 1password is significantly more difficult than it was on my p8  Chrome and Firefox both try and take over secrets and auto complete  even though I have 1password set  Im stuck 75 of the time going to 1pw and manually copypasting info  which Im certain the copy buffers are being recorded by Google  tin hat mode invoked It runs VERY hot while charging I understand thermodynamics to a degree  but this is off the charts from any phone Ive had in 30 years  using nonGoogle supplied 45w charger it charges insanely slowly  like 8 hours to go from 10 from overnight to 100 using the google supplied p8 charger block which I think is 25w facial recognition is a LOT worse in lower light conditions than it was on the p8","2025-03-26 19:01:38"

"Negative","2018 Kia Niro  Motorola M1  Pixel 4a M1 connection madness driving me crazy.I love my MA1 when its working but it has the most bizarre connection issues Usually itll connect immediately when I get in the car but at random it wont connect at all and nothing I do seems to help and then it randomly starts working again And I feel like Im practicing voodoo trying to get it to work reliablyEarlier this week it completely refused to connect for a couple days and then at one point yesterday I got in the car while on a phone call and it connected immediately And then this morning it stopped connecting again So naturally I tried starting it up while on a phone call again and it doesnt help Voodoo Sometimes my phone says continue on your car screen but the AA icon doesnt show up on the car screen Sometimes my phone says its already connected to AA but its notIve tried connecting the phone directly via usb and then switching to the MA1 and that sometimes works but usually doesnt Ive tried turning bluetooth on and off which sometimes works and usually doesnt Ive tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling Android Auto with the same inconsistent results clearing Android Autos cache clearing Bluetooth cache etc Ive tried repairing the phone to the MA1 with the same inconsistent results Ive tried briefly pressing the button on the MA1 in the vain hope that its some sort of voodoo that will make it work and that never helps I tried factory resetting the MA1 once and I think that worked but I dont want to do that every time it gets flaky like thisI feel like Im in a cargo cult and whether or not it connects has nothing to do with all these things Im doing its just that coincidentally sometimes I do something and it connects so I think that what I just did must be the solutionWhen it DOES connect it stays connected without any problems usually for several days although sometimes only until I turn off the car Today it wouldnt connect and then suddenly connected a full 5 minutes after I started driving and then wouldnt connect again the rest of the dayAnd of course it doesnt help matters that there are three potential points of failure here my phone the MA1 and the car and I have no idea which one is actually causing this problemDoes anyone have any suggestions for how I can fix this or at least diagnose whats going on","2024-10-03 03:08:26"
