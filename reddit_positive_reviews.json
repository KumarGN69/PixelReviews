tech every day like all of my favorite YouTubers There has to be research involvedI need to know what Im buying will keep me happy for longer than the 14 day return period So with 3 topend phones in my crosshairs the iPhone X the Pixel 2XL and the Note 8 I drudged through pages and pages of reddit reviews watched hours of video commentary and came to one conclusion I have no idea what phone to buy so why not try out all 3 Since Im a man of limited means Id have to try them out one at a time I started the upgrade process on my account and set my sights on the first prize the iPhone X  Xtra screen Xtra priceyThe iPhone X is arguably the most beautiful slab of glass and stainless steel Ive ever held in my hands The weight of the phone lets you know youve spent money on something well built I felt like when I had this thing out showing it off I was the center of attentionusually because I was It is a near perfect monument of what the path to the perfect iPhone has been for Apple The screen alone almost makes the phone worth it with its vivid punchy colors and amazing brightness The screen almost looks TOO good Like you can reach in and touch the icons The notch while noticeable for about 3 minutes just melts away I only noticed it when a video zoomed in past its pillar boxes Even then the notch didnt seem to upset me What did upset me was learning the gestures Some of them make sense swiping up from the bottom to close an app for instance But others like getting to the background apps felt slow and clunky And getting to the control center should be easier than it is Its not a one handed operation but I really feel it should be Sure if you have big hands like I do you can stretch your thumb out But if you have small hands its not going to be easy What made iOS great in the past was its simplicity and intuitiveness All of that seems to have been forgotten with the X and iOS 11 What has stayed simple though is Apples top notch bio metricsFaceID sounds like a bigger gimmick than square hamburger patties at Wendys I mean Android has had this for years right Wrong FaceID was easy to set up and quick to unlock The amazing subtle features that come with FaceID like hiding notifications on the lock screen until the phone recognizes you is just amazing I liked that I didnt have to position my face in some weird pose or angle for it to work either It just worked and thats what Apple people know and love Animojiswhile an even bigger gimmick were fun to play around with and really showcases what that front camera is capable of Speaking of Cameras both cameras did great the pics looked decently colored and I really love iOSs live photos with 3D touch Its about the only thing I used 3D touch for and its done well The video recording was very well done with 4k  60FPS being its biggest highlight The only thing I thought that wasnt well done was the OISto be honest I had to double check to make sure the phone HAD OIS because it didnt feel like it Hopefully that gets fixed in a software update Overall though the cameras can hold their own with the best that Android has to offer However after using the phone for a little bit I really felt cheated I was not seeing the smooth as silk iOS I had been told of for many years I was not getting top of the line battery life from a 1100 phone And as an android user for the last 6 years things just felt clunky navigating around the OS I missed things Ive taken for granted for years like my notifications with LEDs AOD and setting my own default apps Some of these things I could get adjusted to and I realize iOS 11 is going through a rough patch But all in all it just wasnt feeling like I could justify purchasing the X and telling myself to adapt to my phone instead of my phone adapting to meLets go back to the Android basics 2 XL styleBeing on ATT I couldnt just go into the store and subsidize a Pixel 2 XL That alone bugs me I HATE carrier exclusive phones Yes I know I can buy the phone direct from Google and thats good But theres something nice about going to a carrier store picking up the phone you want right there and walking out paying only sales tax with a big bill later Lucky for me one of my friends owns a shiney new Pixel 2 XL and let me play with it for a day Holy bananas this phone is snappyno snappy isnt good enough Its itsGoogle needs to invent a new word for how fast this phone feels Ive been on the Samsung train for most of my Android life with the Oneone and the Nexus 6 being the only two exceptions I honestly thought that the whole skipping frames and sluggishness you read about on the I hate Samsung train that is rAndroid was a bunch of nonsense Even my S7Edge felt fine to me No real slowdowns or anything Nope I was wrong WAAAAAY wrong The Pixel 2 XL felt like I had stepped out of a Toyota Corolla and into a Ferrari My friend laughed as I scrolled through the app drawer for minutes just saying its sooo smooth  From one Samsung fanboy to the rest of you out there your phone is slow you just dont realize it The camera was the other area this phone just steps out into its own I could not get it to take a bad photo to save my life Putting it against my other coworkers iPhone 8 she was even blown away by how the photos looked just like real life I briefly tried out the video functionality and cannot figure out how this camera manages to make better videos than phones with dual lens setups and OIS on everything except the user itself My only complaint about the camera was I didnt have a lot of shooting mode options Everything was very basic with just a couple of modes Google keeping it simple for the user definitely works for a lot of people but I do like having options like a manual modeThe Pixel 2s biggest controversy since its release is its less than stellar screen Once again coming from Samsung and even playing with the iPhone X I think Im a pretty good judge  when it comes to OLED displays I have almost nothing bad to say about the 2 XLs display The blueshift on the phone I tested didnt stand out to me as anything bad and really felt overblown especially when looking at other OLEDs I checked for light bleed and didnt see any And while my friends 2 XL is only a week old I didnt see any burn in or image retention but he does keep the brightness in check so as to not suffer the wrath of the burn in gods  Speaking of brightness this seems to be my only gripe with the screen At max brightness it just barely seemed to hang in there especially in direct sunlight While I could see what was on screen dark colors just merged together and details cant stand out Out of the 3 phones I tested this was by far the darkest screen Its great for indoors but I wasnt overly thrilled taking it outside   Now I fully admit I dont get the religious Pure Android or nothing attitude I see on Reddit I think OEM skins arent just nice but vital to forcing Google to incorporate the best of each skin into new iterations of Android AOD Multiapp display and a ton of other features in Android are thanks to LG Samsung and all the others out there pushing the limits of their vision of Android  That being said simple Android is pretty easy to use and Id even argue maybe even easier to use than iOS lately After tinkering with the 2 XL I can definitely see the appeal but I do and always will love feature rich skins that provide users with an even more engrossing and productive experience A noteworthy experience but can it lastMy final phone tested was the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 This phone is so big I had to get permits from the city just to let me put it in my house I kid but while expensive the Note 8 will at least leave you with the feeling you got a LOT for your money And you really do too That pen just keeps getting smarter every iteration of the Note line With it being able to do text translations and live messaging its a gimmick feature that I kept finding myself going back to I was looking for excuses to pull out the pen and do new things on the screenthat gorgeous beautiful screen Picasso once said Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot others transform a yellow spot into the sun Samsung has managed to create not another copy of an OLED display but THE OLED display for others to copy What the Note 8 lacks in fluidity and it does it makes up for in the most stunning display and feature rich experience in all of the 3 phones I tested From app pairing to cutting out sections of the screen drawing notes and then texting them faster than it took for me to write this sentence the Note 8 has abilities that would make a swiss army knife blush I was finding new things to do with the phone every time I picked it up Its almost overwhelming And therein lies the problem with Samsung vs Android purists Samsung weighs itself down with a constant influx of features at the expense of ram and processing power THANKFULLY Im happy to say that the Note 8 experience was a smooth one Not NEARLY as smooth as the Pixel 2 XL but Samsung has made ungodly strides in improving performance and it shows in the Note 8 Thats not to say there werent the occasional frame drop here and there now that I know what to look for with my Pixel experience I can hear what youre thinking Smooth now but give it a month or two and I would agree with you My Galaxy S6 was probably the worst offender in recent memory However I was able to compare the new Note 8 in my hand to another coworkers Note 8 theyve had since launch Everything seemed to be identical in terms of smoothness and the benchmarks were practically the same I tried to break both phones bogging them down with running apps music and video But to my surprise both phones held steady What didnt hold steady was the battery life I found it to be just barely ok I think that with quick charge we are becoming accustomed to fast charging top offs at the expense of sub par battery life Samsung really needs to address this in the next Note phone because a productivity phone that you use during the work day SHOULD be able to get you through the work day without the feeling of panic by 2 PM I hope Samsung shakes off the PTSD they gained from the Note 7 disaster We need battery innovation and the Note 8 is a great example of why Camera wise the Note 8 took great photos for a normal guy like myself But the iPhone X did a  better job and the 2 XL blew both of them out of the water The one area I felt the Note 8 shined over the other 2 was in video recording The image stabilization was excellent on the Note as well as the recorded sound quality While the iPhone Xs recorded sound was very quiet and the 2 XLs was very tinny the Note 8 had a very good balance of audio quality and ambient noise reduction This surprised me since I didnt think Samsung cared about sound because the Note comes with a single bottom firing speakerits 2017 Samsung stereo speakers are a thing Im sorry for yelling Samsungplease dont kill off the headphone jack Ok OkTLDR what did I pick While beautiful I couldnt get myself used to the Apple ecosystem so the X was out The 2 XL cant be purchasedsubsidized through ATTs Next program and I refuse to switch to Verizon so that was out Which leaves me with the Note 8 I loved all three phones for plenty of reasons and you CANT go wrong with any of them The iPhone X is a beautifulBEAUTIFUL work of art the Pixel 2 XL is a purist dream come true that is faster than any phone Ive ever played with and the Note 8 is a treasure trove of features and a display that will melt your eyes with its beauty  I count myself lucky to live in an age of these beautiful devices and am fortunate to be able to own one EDIT Thank you so much for the goldEDIT2 Fixed spelling errors and carrier skins to OEM skins  thanks uexelero88","7":"Pixel Super Bowl Commercial.So Im watching the Super Bowl with 15 iPhone users and they were all glued to the TV

who wrote that absurdly long Android 13 changelog articlehttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdive or as the former EditorinChief of XDADevelopers Im here because Android 13 will soon be released and I figured not everyone here is clued in about whats included in the update If you have a Pixel 4 or later youll have plenty of opportunity to play around with it soon if you havent already enrolled in the beta If you want a summary of what features to look out for though Ive got you coveredBelow youll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think Pixel users like you should be aware of Ill start out by listing 10 features that will likely only be used by Pixels current and future or at the very least will arrive first on Pixel followed by 50 features that should be common across Android 13 devices Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details but Ill also provide a summary under each item for a quick tldr For the 50 nonPixelexclusive Android features Ive roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features and yes you may not care about everything in the list Still theres a lot thats new in the Android 13 update so I hope you find a few things youre excited aboutWithout further ado heres my list1 Cinematic wallpapershttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivecinematicwallpapers In Android 13 DP2 I discovered strings within the WallpaperPicker app that suggest youll be able to make your photo a 3D wallpaper that moves when your phone moves The Android System Intelligence app is hinted at being as the systems wallpaper effects generation service ie itll be what actually turns photos into 3D wallpapers Keep in mind this feature isnt available yet and it could never launch This could be something Google is holding off until the Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel Tablet launch2 Resolution switchinghttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdiveresolutionswitching Pixel devices have never had a way to switch between FHD and QHD resolution on devices where that might make sense like the XLPro models with QHD panels Android 13 however adds screen resolution settings that appear whenever a FHD and QHD display mode are exposed to Android No Pixels right now do that but there are rumors that the Pixel 7 Pros panel will support FHD as well as QHD The reason Slightly better battery life when running graphically intensive apps Heres a screenshot of what the page will look likehttpsi0wpcomblogesperiowpcontentuploads202204Android13screenresolutionsettingspngresize5402C1170ssl13 Hub modehttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivehubmode Android 13 is preparing a hub mode feature that will let users access apps across profiles Right now if you want to access an app from another profile you have to switch to that profile With hub mode youd be able to access them from say the ambient display Theres not a lot thats known about this feature and it could have been pushed back to a future release but Im thinking its aimed at shared devices like what the upcoming Pixel Tablet seems to be ie a hybrid of a Nest Hub  an Android tablet Heres a screenshot of the trusted network settings for Hub modehttpsi0wpcomblogesperiowpcontentuploads202204Android13hubmodesettingspngw613ssl1 Anotherhttpsi0wpcomblogesperiowpcontentuploads202204Android13hubmodetrustednetworkspngw613ssl14 Screen saver revamphttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivescreensaverrevamp Another feature thats likely aimed at the Pixel Tablet but also other shareddockable devices is the revamped screen saver experience in Android 13 You probably wont see this on your phone ever but Android 13 can show complications yes like the watch kind on top of screen savers There are complications for air quality cast info datetime and weather Heres a screenshot of the complications

adds support for Media Tap To Transfer a feature that will let you send media from one device like a smartphone to another like a tablet The actual media transfer will likely be handled by Google Play Services and Im guessing this feature could debut with the Pixel Tablet Despite its name the transfer protocol could be NFC Bluetooth UWB or something else6 Multiple Enabled Profiles on a single eSIMhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivemultipleenabledprofiles Want to ditch your physical SIM card Android 13 adds support for eSIM MEP or Multiple Enabled Profiles to let you simultaneously use two or more SIM profiles stored on a single eSIM chip I dont know which Pixels will support this sadly7 Virtualization supporthttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivevirtualization This one is really complicated but basically Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature pKVM to be precise as the hypervisor with crosvm as the virtual machine manager Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose isolated compilation but devs have figured out how to boot Linux and even Windows VMshttpsblogesperioandroiddessertbites13virtualizationonpixel6379185 with it Youll need a device that supports pKVM like the Pixel 6 6 Pro and I think 6a 8 exFAT supporthttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdiveexfat You can finally mount an exFAT drive if you have a Pixel 6 6 Pro or 6a This only works on Pixels with Linux 510 but as for why it also requires Android 13 the reason is kind of sillyhttpsblogesperioandroiddessertbites27exfatonpixel5321768499 Ambient Context eventshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdiveambientcontext You know how the Nest Hub can detect your coughing or snoring Remember the rumorhttps9to5googlecom20220526pixelandroidsnoredetection about Google adding builtin snoringcough detection for Pixel That will likely make use of Android 13s Ambient Context API Theres already a hinthttpstwittercomMishaalRahmanstatus1530017887854813184 that Digital Wellbeing will make use of the API10 Crossdevice callinghttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivecrossdevicecalling When the Pixel Tablet comes out Im sure youll want a way to take a phone call on it when your phone isnt on you Through Android 13s crossdevice calling API this could be possible11 Runtime permission for notificationshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivenotificationpermission Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not its newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13 but this generally makes notifications optin rather than optout Examplehttpsi0wpcomblogesperiowpcontentuploads202204Android13runtimepermissionfornotificationspngw598ssl112 New Material You dynamic color styleshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivematerialyoustyles Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Googles dynamic color engine which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values By adjusting these values the color engine can create a bunch of

UIhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivemediacontrolsplaybackstate Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13 This is because Android 13 derives what

static spatial audio where the sound seems to move as your head moves and dynamic spatial audio where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves Static spatial audio works with any headphones while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support Android 12L added the audio spatializer APIhttpsblogesperioandroid12ldeepdiveandroid12laudiospatialization needed for

sideloaded appshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdiverestrictedsettingsappop Androids Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful and theyre often abused by malware Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs and in Android 13 youll be blocked from enabling an apps Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store There is a way to unblock access fortunately The exact details are more complicated so I recommend reading this article for the full

permissionshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivemediafilepermissions Scoped Storage changed how apps access fileshttpsblogesperiohowscopedstorageworks making it so that the READEXTERNALSTORAGE permission doesnt grant broad access to the external shared storage Instead it only let apps access media files including audio video and image files owned by other apps that reside in media store collections In Android 13 apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files video files or image files owned by other apps making media file access even more granular40 Revamped multiuser UIhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivetableofcontentstextSquiggly20progress20barMultiuserFullscreen20user20profile Theres a couple of enhancements to the multiuser experience in

Android 1344 Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in splitscreenhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivedraglaunchmultiinstancesplitscreen Android 12 added multiinstance support making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity For example you can launch two Chrome windows in splitscreen mode Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in splitscreen view provided the activity supports it45 Take away an apps ability to turn on the screenhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdiveturnscreenonpermission Theres a new turn screen on permission that you can control in Settings  Apps  Special app access Its quite selfexplanatory Heres a screenshot of the permission pagehttpsi0wpcomblogesperiowpcontentuploads202205Android13turnscreenonpermissionpagepngw613ssl146 Control background access of body sensorshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivebackgroundbodysensors Apps can access data from heart rate temperature and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODYSENSORS permission Prior to Android 13 apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODYSENSORSBACKGROUND47 Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi deviceshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivenearbywifidevices Its possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and WiFi devices over time which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and WiFi scan results That got annoying and confusing for users so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission Android 13 follows up by decoupling WiFi scanning from location permissions48 Camera2 improvementshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivecamera2improvements Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps and its getting some welcome additions in Android 13 First it has added HDR video capture supporthttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivecamera2hdrvideo so thirdparty camera apps can finally capture HDR video provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL Theres a new API for preview stabilization and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well These are more developerfocused improvements but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a thirdparty camera app49 Faster hyphenationhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivefasterhyphenation Text wrapping will be better in Android 13 as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field Hyphenation seems like a simple matter but before Android 13 it was quite taxing on the

wrappinghttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivejapanesetextwrapping Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by Bunsetsu which is the smallest unit of words thats coherent instead of by character This will make text more readable by Japanese users51 Improved line heights for nonLatin scriptshttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdiveimprovedlineheightsnonlatin Android 13 improves support for nonLatin scripts like Tamil Burmese Telugu and Tibetan The OS uses a line height thats adapted for each language preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters52 MIDI 20 supporthttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivemidi20 MIDI 20 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bidirectionality so devices can communicate with each other to autoconfigure themselves or exchance info on available functionality It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32bit resolution support53 DNSoverHTTP3 supporthttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivednsoverhttps Android 9 added encrypted DNS ie Private DNS support through the DNSoverTLS protocol Android 13 adds support for the DNSoverHTTP3 protocol This implementation offers better performance and security Right now Androids DNSoverHTTP3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 1112L and some Android 10 devices54 Androids Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline modulehttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivebluetoothmodule Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common so in an effort to improve security Android 13 turns Androids Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components However Im not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs55 Androids ultrawideband stack becomes a Mainline modulehttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdiveuwbmodule In a similar vein Androids ultrawide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13 There arent many devices yet with UWB hardware but with this  the new UWB Jetpack libraryhttpsdeveloperandroidcomjetpackandroidxreleasescoreuwb we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates56 Binary transparencyhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivebinarytransparency If you care about security then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match whats included in the official factory images Android 13s binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device so you can compare them with the official images Note that while Googles the only one doing this so far AFAIK theres nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs57 Dynamic System Updates become a lot fasterhttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivedsuimprovements Dynamic System Updates DSU makes it easy to install a Generic System Image GSI without overwriting your devices original installation or wiping your data All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Googles official GSIs through the DSU Loader setting Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive58 ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performancehttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdiveartupdates An update to the Android Runtime ART module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linuxs userfaultd feature which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes59 Wallpaper dimminghttpsblogesperioandroid13deepdivecinematicwallpapers Theres a new API to dim the wallpaper and its being used

get a cheap 30 smart watch off of temu until I can afford to get a pixel watch or someone gets on my offer to buy my watch Thank you in advance T mobile not doing any promotions at the moment for it sadly","28":"iOS vs PixelAndroid my experience.So Ive been working on this for a few months and posted it a couple of times and got some helpful feedback and I think its finally ready to share This will be mostly an Apple vs Pixel comparison but for the most part goes for all Android phones For context I went from Pixel 4a  iPhone 13 Pro  Pixel 5 I used the iPhone for 5 months before throwing in the towel These are obviously not all of the differences but these are the ones that I found most impactful on my personal experienceIn order from most impactful to least Pros iOS is just way faster and more reliable Apps work so much better and faster on iOS and contain additional features that are simply missing from their Android counterparts Memory management is better apps seem to never ever have to relaunch Apple does more with less software is better optimized to make the most of the hardware It really does seem to just work for the most part What it does do it does consistently well and things behave the way you expect them to I havent encountered a single bug By far and away the biggest pro Definitely other people I know have experienced bugs but most people seem to agree with this on the whole My Pixel 4a had a number of issues The most significant of which was a proximity sensor issue presumably that would turn off the screen when I had an incoming call making it unable to answer and making me unable to access the buttons in the middle of a call And the fingerprint sensor did not work I had it replaced and it worked again for a few weeks and then stopped working again WiFi calling does not work on my Pixel 5 just silence and I had to disable the DNS because it was causing me to lose service altogether mobile and WiFi multiple timesday until I restarted it which was also really fun to diagnose iMessage Really only a benefit because other people I message have iPhones Android has an equivalent product but like many of their equivalent products they have failed to proliferate Perhaps a downside to the customization of Android is carriersOEMs fight over standardization which means nobody uses any of them Its fine but thanks to Apple it only works on Apple devices Support if you need help with an issue unless you pay extra for AppleCare Apple will direct you to their mostly useless online selfhelp resources but worstcase scenario you can just walk into an Apple store assuming you have one nearby and they wont  turn you away When I was looking for a new phone it felt like there were no Android OEMs that wanted to sell me a phone When I walked into the Apple store this is what ultimately sold me Their reps are super nice and eager to help Google has Preferred Care via uBreakiFix but its really not the same experience and there are no Google Stores to my knowledge Video quality is drastically better than anything available on Android thanks to the optics and A15 chip I dont think anyone will argue against that However its worth noting that the vast majority of the time when you share those videos the quality is just murdered to the point that it really doesnt matter Ecosystem If you DO have ALL Apple products they work together exceptionally well Android has some stopgap solutions with Windows but unless youre using a Chromebook which comes with its own compromises there is no powerful and versatile desktoplaptop solution There is no good tablet or watch currently There are options on the horizon but theyve tried this before and failed Connectivity I seemed to always have service interruptions and weird quirks and bugs with every Android phone The iPhone was exceptional in that regard and I had service in many places I did not with other phones Battery life Its a longboi Apples vertical integration allows for super powerful but also high efficiency hardware The battery will easily last me a couple of days Haptic Feedback yes its as good as everyone says its almost like a whole language and the ability to customize your own haptic feedback is pretty awesome Shortcuts I didnt really get around to using these but it is quite a neat feature but not super userfriendly The fact that theres a sort of store where you can simply install them is supercool and makes them more userfriendly Its pretty annoying that a notification pops up each time a Shortcut is run Android has some similar but inferior apps like Macrodroid and IFTTT but nothing baked into the OS Google has routines via Assistant but theyre incredibly limited in what they can do iPhones have 5 years of software support The latest Pixels get at least 3 years for OS updates and 5 years for security updates that may include feature drops Most Android phones are lucky to get 2 but Pixels have a good track record Hold that thought though until we get to the consCons Spam handling As someone who receives about 45 annoying spam textscalls per day they just make me miserable Firstly and Im not sure if this is particular to the Pixel or just the Google phone app but Google runs any incoming calls against their Google Maps database so it gives you a sort of quasicallerID whatever happened to caller ID anyway Secondly the Pixel has the Call Screen feature and a robust SMS spam filtering service not to mention Hold For Me and Direct My Call that works really well There are very few things I consider invaluable in a smartphone but Call Screen is one of them Theres nothing more satisfying than looking down at a silent notification and seeing that some spammer or robocall was screened and declined You dont even realize how well the SMS filter works until you go into the spam folder and look at all the messages it filteredor buy an iPhone iMessage hasalmost nothing You can filter unknown senderscallers and you can bring in other 3rd party callmessage filtering apps but they dont seem to work well and are typically a paid service When searching through Apple support they just direct you to talk to your carrier Blocking callers is like a 12step process and theres not even a way to mark them as junk This was the last straw for me and why I eventually threw in the towel I had a particularly bad day for spam Like 10 callstexts in the span of a few hours Huge 1 con for sure but thats just me Notification handling and customization On Android notifications are automatically sorted and grouped according to importance Some can be silenced The iOS notification pane again relies on the furthest possible corner of the phone if youre righthanded Persistent notifications are nonexistent and I find this means my notifications are regularly missed or forgotten about After a while I realized there are lock screen notifications and then there are MORE OTHER NOTIFICATIONS when you pull down the notification shade FUCKING WHY The swipe gestures are difficult to use Many times I try to do a horizontal halfswipe or whatever to get to the options menu to change notification settings but then swipe a little too far and it disappears from existence Theres no way to access notification history like you can very easily and intuitively on Android so theyre just gone forever Ive noticed many people pay no attention to their notifications as they have a thousand of them but I manage them very closely on Android to ensure the important stuff was prioritized The notifications on iOS dont disappear when I read them on another device specifically Gmail like they do on Android Keyboard The fact that after all these years Apple still does such a bad job with something so simple and something you interact with every time you pick up the device is nothing short of astonishing The Apple keyboard has a mindbendingly stupid buttonaccessed second layer for all punctuation and numericals GBoard on Android allows you to add a second longpress layer add a number row and resize the keyboard to maximize screen real estate Swipe typing on iOS justdoesnt seem to work very well at all Swipe typing on Android makes onehanded typing very easy I can even do it without looking The Android keyboard also has a dedicated button to dock it where on iOS I have a hard time figuring out how to put it away SOMETIMES you can swipe down and it disappears but other times it doesnt and its just very confusing and inconsistent The audible feedback on iOS is just this loud almost earshattering clack GBoard has a nice sound like rubbing your finger on a piece of paper It also has different sounds for the space and backspace buttons that legitimately make it easier to type faster and more accurately 3rd party keyboards make typing a little better but still much worse than GBoard Antirighttorepair stance Does it really do any good to have 5 years of software support if they dont support the hardware Apple is an industryleader in preventing repairs of their own devices and irreparable construction methods They go to great lengths to ensure this going so far as to serialize virtually every part like camera modules so they wont work even if you swap them from one iPhone to another They have also sent ICE to raid small businesses who are using OEM parts sold illegally from Chinese distributors and sent out cease and desist letters and threatened lawsuits The agreements with Apples vendors preclude them from selling any of their own parts to anyone but Apple That means if you have a broken 5 microchip you cant easily get it repaired anywhere and Apple will tell you you need to replace the entire device at a price that is not at all costeffective in an effort to get you to trash it and buy a new one Although they do provide costeffective solutions for common replacements like screens and batteries Custom notification sounds This is a huge one for me because I can tell the priority level of any notification without pulling the phone out of my pocket and whether or not I need to readrespond This helps tremendously for me to maintain focus on what Im doing Not possible on most iOS apps No universal back gesture This is something I used on Android every time I picked up the phone Its very intuitive and natural if you want to go back you just swipe from the edge of the screen iOS doesnt seem to have any sort of universal back function at all Sometimes you can swipe from the left of the screen to the right but it is inconsistent as to when you can do this Also even when it does work swiping left to right is not the easiest thing to do righthanded The Android gesture is ambidextrous Desktop messaging More walled garden problems In order to use a desktop client you must have an Apple computer On Android you can use whatever you want its just done through the browser So Im forced to type on and read from my tiny little phone screen when Im at home on that miserable little keyboard instead of my 49 desktop monitor and fullsize physical keyboard Text selection It boggles my mind that something so simple can be implemented so poorly and for so long I still dont understand how its supposed to work because it seems to do something different every time Longpressing on the screen brings up a magnified view which is promptly hidden by the finger youre using to select when moving up Moving this magnified view updown on the screen and enlarging it seems like a super obvious and simple fix to this issue It could even be tailored to right and lefthanded users but that type of customization is atypical of Apple You can also longpress on the space bar but the thing moves so damn fast that its incredibly difficult to get the cursor where you want it It seems the obvious and simple fix is just to slow it down I can send fucking memojis and Venmo payments but contacts cannot be sent from within iMessage I used this daily in Google Messages instead of typing out my name and title Instead I have to send through the contacts app which makes it not even worth the effort I just end up typing in my information on that miserable little keyboard I suspect this is another walled garden thing because it will send it automatically through iMessage if you opt into it Weight I guess some people equate a heavy phone with premium build quality Im of the opposite opinion Pixel 5 is 151g vs iPhone 13P 204g 35 lighter Keep in mind both of these devices are very close in external dimensions Most of this weight savings is derived from the more durable aluminum frame construction vs heavier more fragile premium glass No plugins for Firefox ad blockers dark mode etc All browsers are modified versions of Safari Face ID Face ID means you have a notch in the top of your screen which takes up the space used by persistent notifications in Android This is not an issue specifically with Apples implementation of Face ID but just the concept of Face ID in general If you ask me FaceID offers no benefits to account for this and they figured out biometric verification with the iPhone 5s fingerprint sensor Shortly after that many Android OEMs moved the sensor to the back of the phone to free up screen real estate its also just a more convenient location Anything and everything after that has just been an attempt at perceived progress while actually being the opposite in my opinion Default SMS If for example you wanted to use Signal on Android you can set it as the default messenger and it will just default to SMS if the person youre messaging is not using Signal Not possible on iOS Stupid fucking lightning cables Absolutely no reason for these things to have them but you have to spend another 100 on a whole set of new cables you have to carry around in addition to USBC cables for other devices for absolutely no reason Aesthetics Pixels and Google in general just feel very fun Very colorful and the Pixel UI reflects that with beautiful preloaded wallpapers that regularly rotate themselves out by default and Material You that gives you lots of fun colors and just generally being really nice to look at iOS on the contrary is fairly boring to look at and does not change on a regular basis much less in the last 5 years Slow charging 75W wireless 20W wired Bit of a nitpick here since theyre more efficient and have smaller batteries but many Android flagships are running 45200W charging My Pixel 5 is only 18W wired but 12W wireless with compatible charger obviously Not a huge issue either way for me personally as Im never far from a charger for very long Siri vs Google Assistant Google Assistant is still just so so much better Cost the iPhone 13 Pro I bought was 1k The Pixel 4a I had previously which is in my opinion superior was 350Conclusion The iPhone works better but the PixelAndroid does more I think thats the most succinct way I can put itApple really nails the difficult stuff like reliability efficiency ecosystem and speed but just flops on the easy stuff which is such a shame It would be very easy for them to make the iPhone 1000 better I will deal with the occasional bugs to achieve greater functionality","29":"USACO H iPhone 13 Pro Max 256GB Graphite Google Pixel 7 Pro 128 GB Obsidian Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic 46mm Google Pixel Buds Pro Xbox One S 500 GB W PaypalLocal Cash.Selling

the same treatment as other brands.TL DR S22 series release and reviews made me appreciate my 6 pro even more and start questioning reviewers bias and the state of the smartphones marketStay with me it is a pixel post although the S22 reviews made me write thisIve watched a few reviews about the S22 series and they look great love the matt glass and really wish google did this for the 6 Pro However theres one review I was waiting the most for and thats MKBHDs one Beautiful videos lots of details etc and I kind of tend to feel he is not that biased about android brandsunder question nowHis S22 review left me with a mixed bag of feelings Not a single mention of price to specs ratio You get a 1080p screen not a LTPO screen not really a camera upgrade on paper with a marginal actual quality improvement of photos What really annoyed me though was his comment on battery life 45 hours of screen on time in about 29 hours off the charger and he said thats good I dont know how many of you remember but his pixel 6 pro got 45 hours of SoT and he called it trash while the phone is 100 cheaper than the S22 and you get way better spec on paper and reality This is not even to mention the fact that I believe he got a lemon as lots of people have great battery life on their 6 pros and I personally get around 67 hours SoT with 30 left before going to bedIt really bothers me that because phones are considered flagships price doesnt matter anymore How does one justify paying more money for less specs and does not even mention it Not even talking about the ultra which is 400 more and you dont really get anything more apart from the pen which I think is really cool nonetheless I feel like price should be important as paying hundreds more for marginal upgrades is crazy It supports the idea that companies can keep increasing prices because people will see them as more premium when in reality it offers barely anything In my opinion Google hit the nail with the pixel 6 series yes both the regular and the pro because I can hardly find a phone nowadays that offers as much as the pixel while still being affordable Heck even the a series are getting a lot better now with the improved design no compromises on the processor side as well with the Tensor and great cameras To finish this rant  I think major reviewers should consider the price of a phone more rather than just them being flagships and comparing them all together Theres a huge difference between paying 850 and 1300 for what seems marginally better products","31":"iOS vs Android Pixel comparison Part 1 Why Pixel Outshines iPhone.As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel Ive noticed several areas where Pixel excels Heres my breakdown\u00a0 Edit Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom due to

useful Intuitive notification management eg disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app\u00a0 2 Clear Interactive System Information Detailed charging speed

are more helpful than iOS Maybe because its older feature so Its much adopted You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and Im addicted to it right now Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for nonnative English speakers\u00a0 5 Multimedia and Connectivity More practical PictureinPicture PiP functionality Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay especially for web pages and not so popular website Specially in background continuity of the casting You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet\u00a0 6 Communication Features Full call history logs Easy one here iPhone \u00a0 7 Customization and Productivity Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature Specially you can pin you copies for ever The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it In this way you will have bigger windows but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as its on chrome browser on windows Its fast accurate and never disappoint you Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons\u00a0 8 App Availability I dont why but Android in general have collection of not wellknown apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use For example in Android in IPTV 9stream You cannot find similar app on iPhone Downloading apps from outside the Play store gives you the freedom you have on windows\u00a0 9 Device Analysis Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights Part 2 why iOS in some parts outperform Android PixelNow the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel 1 Better Face UnlockiOSs Face ID is still the best in class Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure For example it cannot verify your wallet payment 2 Unified Call HistoryHaving all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important I know some users hate this feature but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work 3 Spotlight SearchSpotlight search is the Feature No 1 that I wish android has One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device even files documents photos For example if you swipe down and type passport iOS will give you the passport document in Files app in addition to the Passport screenshots photos in your Photos app 4 Text Cursor ControlHold space to move the cursor making text editing easier Better than the one in Gboard 5 Privacy in TrackingBetter control and transparency over app tracking 6 VPN in SafariBuiltin VPN support while Google Ones VPN isnt available in my country 7BestinClass AccessoriesAir Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone  For example If I wear the AirPods while Im watching Youtube in the Apple TV notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone neat featureAlso you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone 8 Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight 9CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay Carplay is far more stable and reliable I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado and I never having it disconnected from the car In Android two three times a week 10Touch Screen QualityI dont why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel Its more accurate and shorter response time 11 Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devicesThis is an important point Document folder in iOS iCloud is the same on all Apple devices So without uploading or backing up files If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device 12Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also 13 Stable and Polished AppsAndroid has made good leap on this part but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts 14iMessage and FacetimeFor me Facetime is really handy iMessage are major for the users in US For us here we use WhatsApp mainlywe reach the end I hope  its helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons","32":"Thinking of switching from iPhoneApple Watch to Pixel Pro 7Pixel Watch  I have 2 questions to help me make my mind up.1 Can you set the always on display to only on during activity I could only do this through clunky automation on the Apple Watch The only time I dont want a delay on seeing the display is when Im runningcycling etc 2 Can you go for a run with just the watch and pixel buds ie no phone I never had a lot of success doing this on Apple songs wouldnt load AirPods wouldnt connect to the watch or the tracking would be extremely inaccurate and always just brought my giant phone with me Should I get wifi or LTE if I intend to do thisIm just a bit over Apple but nervous as Ive had iPhones since 2010 and Apple Watches since 2016 I also like that the Fitbit app seems to contain what I use about 6 different apps for Plus I love the round face But any tips on making the transition including if I really shouldnt lol would be appreciated","33":"Ive had my Pixel 7 for about a year now and I miss my Pixel 2 rant.My pixel 2 died last year and I had to scramble to get a new phone by the end of the weekendSure the 7 is nice I like the battery saving features its fast and the camera and screen are great but this phone sucks in comparisonI miss the squeeze feature to get my assistant I miss the fingerprint scanner in the backThis new scanner is hot trash and doesnt detect my fingerprint nearly as accurately My pixel 2 was accurate almost every time as long as my finger wasnt wet or dirty AND you could access your drop down menu easily by scrolling your finger on the scanner I need 2 hands to do that nowI miss my old assistant and voice to text It may be because of an Android update but the new assistant isnt as good the voice to text is ALWAYS WRONG I CANT TRUST IT EVERMy old phone was super accurate with voice to text it rarely betrayed me like this phone does and last November it didnt even sing me happy birthday in the morning like my old phone didToday my assistant kicked on for no reason at work Nobody was talking it just activated like I said Hey Google and my old phone never did thatOh and now I cant even hold the home button for my assistant Who thought that was a good idea The option isnt even there they just took it awayThese are little things but they add up My biggest gripe though is a two part1 The phone is HEAVY with a decent case its like twice the weight of my Pixel 2 Kickstands on this phone are super handy to take weight off of your fingers and prop up the phone but2 The cases are garbage Sure the case itself is fine but they dont make cases with a good kickstands Ive been through 2 in less than a year with delicate use and they break like the cheap pieces of garbage that they are This past weekend I pulled my phone out of my pocket and the kickstand came off completelyGoogle is apparently doing what Apple does and making so you have to buy their brand for accessories tooI wanted to get a dongle to watch youtube videos on my TV with my phone because I use an adblock browser fight me and I dont want the ads that come with Chromecast but these newer phones are incompatible with dongles that let you do thatThis will probably be my last pixel phone Im very disappointed with Googles business decisions and going along with the planned obsolescence like everyone else Every generation seems like they take away good features and add unnecessary ones I like smart lens I like adaptive charging but they didnt need to get rid of everything else to add thoseI got 5 good years out of my Pixel 2 before it had any issues only to be reminded that newer isnt always better  EditI fully expected to get blasted into downvote hell and told that Im wrong Im glad reddit agrees with me on something","34":"Is the Google Pixel7 worth it after 6 Months And why would you go for this phone over the Pixel 7 Pro or Pixel 6a Watch my long term review where I answer those questions and more.nan","35":"just bought a Pixel 7 and.this phone might be the best Pixel ever made My past phones have been the Pixel 3 4 5 6 and now the 7This phone is so well polished and feels like a true flagship structurally Feels high quality and the size surprisingly seems much better than the 6 albeit its only a tad smaller This phone is super comfortable and if it was still a tad smaller it would be perfectSo far I havent had that many bugs and the modem seems much much improved The haptics are very impressive and the fingerprint scanner Ive had zero issues I dont usually use any security for locking my phone but it works pretty fast The screen looks good and the max brightness improvement is wicked awesomeThe phone getting hot af seems to also have been fixed Playing a game while watching YouTube simultaneously doesnt heat the phone up that much Might be the most pleasant improvement for me battery so far seems to be optimized more efficiently as wellThis phone truly feels like what the 6 should have been in terms of functionality and the physical build changes feel solid Anyone on the fence with getting this phone I definitely would 500 bucks is such a steal even if you get the 8 when that comes out Cheers all","36":"Pixel 6a Review from an Apple Sheep.First off I am basically the textbook definition of an Apple sheep I am completely bought into the walled garden with many of their products and services I upgrade my iPhone every year watch every launch event and talk about their superiority whenever the topic came up I never thought I would like or want to use an Android phone again after having multiple in years past Then came the Pixel 6aAfter starting my own business I realized I wanted a second phone to keep my personal life separate My iPhone would be the work phone since I used the camera and Apple specific apps constantly for my business Because I had the iPhone I didnt want or need anything super expensive for the personal phone Nothing extremely cheap as I am a tech person and definitely prefer more premium products but I didnt need to spend 1000 on something to text and run social media apps I originally started looking at the iPhone SE as it was cheaper and I would still be in the Apple ecosystem But after watching a few reviews on it people kept comparing it to the Pixel 6a which seemed better in many ways I always had a special interest in the Pixel series even as an Apple fanboy due to the cameras and stock Android One of my main complaints with every Android Ive had has been the bloatware After doing plenty of research I saw the 6a was on sale for 350 at Target and decided to pick one up to try it Much to my surprise I love it This thing is amazing for the price and I see its down to 300 now Total steal The things I like most about itStock AndroidThe stock Android on Pixels is miles better than any bloatwareridden Samsung phone I have ever used This phone is incredibly fast smooth and featurerich without a million random preinstalled apps I love the Material You customization and the Google assistant integration which is miles ahead of Siri The CameraWhile it does have the older Pixel camera setup and you can definitely tell in some conditions the camera on this little guy packs quite the punch Ive especially noticed this with closeup shots I did some macro comparisons with my 14PM and the Pixel was much clearer with better color The portrait mode is nice it has that artificial feel to it but so do the iPhones The astrophotography mode is fantastic and even the normal night mode does a good job Also the magic eraser feature is insanely good I showed it to a couple of my friends and they couldnt believe itThe HapticsWhile Im a big fan of Apples haptics I have to say I enjoy the hardhitting haptics of the Pixel The feedback you get while doing everything from typing to switching apps seems much more pronounced than the iPhone This could be due to it being such a smaller and lighter phone but the weight of this phone is a plus for me as well It feels like nothing in my hands compared to the brick that is the iPhoneOverall I guess when compared with my iPhone it shocks me that a phone this good can be priced this cheap Ive certainly enjoyed my experience with it over the past month and am already looking at the 7 Pro for that camera setup seeing how much I like the cameras on the 6a I will probably force myself to wait for at least the 7a if not the 8 though Pixel congratulations on turning an Apple sheep into someone that now has green bubbles","37":"Phone Call Bug when paired with a Pixel 7 Watch 4.So I just got a Pixel 7 and most functions seem to be working fine even though its a nonSamsung phone But the biggest issue Ive run into is that when I get phone calls it just shows the phone number on the watch and not the contact name Ive granted Google Phone all the permissions including access to contacts Im wondering if theres some confusion happening with the Samsung phone app being on the watch but not on the phone itself even though I have the default phone app set to the Google one Anybody else seeing this behavior Or suggestions on a fix","38":"Does anyone know how to make this go away Ive toggled it on and off like 4 times and restarted the phone Pixel 7 wGalaxy watch 4 classic.nan","39":"Pixel Watch took over phone call from

says Pixel Watch instead of Pixel Buds Why does the watch take overx200BDo I have to factory reset on the watch or is there another way to prevent this from happening again","40":"Pixel 4a Conspiracy perhaps bigger than you think.Edit As pointed out by some users Ive corrected a few things Oct 2021  I ordered a Google Pixel 4a  Main Selling Points Affordability Camera and Unlimited Storage Backup for Google PhotosThe phone had no issues whatsoever at this point untilJan2025  I get a mail from Google  image attached below stating that the Pixel 4a will receive an automatic software update that will dramatically degrade its battery performance and the reason for this update is to improve the phones stability For the record my phone had been working as smoothly as it could I had no issues that would require such a severe update  To tackle this battery issue Google gave us some solutions eligibility based on IMEI number and country image attached below 1 Get a free Battery Replacement2 Get 50 or an equivalent amount of money3 Get 100 or an equivalent amount of money as credit on Google Store that you can use to buy Google Pixel Although I dont see this option anymore on the websiteLate Jan 2025  I get the update and now the phone is no exaggeration UNUSABLE My phone now takes hours and hours to even get from 10 to 50 If I open Youtube for suppose 7 min the phone now drains 7 lmao The only time I could use my phone was when it was plugged into a charger and to top all of that my phones battery has now started to swell  After all of this I was forced to make a choice  The Catch  Thinking about which option I should opt for I found out that except for option 2 the customer is going to get played no matter what they go for1 Whether you go for free Battery Replacement there will be some hidden charges that will be levied on you my experience below2 Or if you opt for a 100 Google Store credit you can only use it to purchase those Google Pixel models that are not on sale that means you cannot buy whichever Pixel you wish to3 Or if you decide to downgrade your software to its previous version then good luck finding one because Google deleted every single one of its older firmware for Pixel 4a  Free Battery Replacement my experience  Before sending my phone for replacement I made some proof videos attached below showing my phones condition  I sent my phone to F1 Info Solution and Services Indore India provided by Google which acted as a mediator between me and Googles Replacement Center Delhi India  After looking at my phone the people at F1 Info Solutions conferred that my phones back panel had been damaged and they would have to now replace it too no other workarounds They said Id have to pay the cost for the back panel plus their service charges I agreed and they sent my phone to the Replacement Center Delhi  Today I get a mail from them attached below and theyve quoted Rs4480 52 for the back panel and Rs1500 17 as their service charge Surprising how things can go from Free to Rs6000 70For the record my phone wasnt swollen before the update It was due to the Software update that the phones battery swole up and my back panel got damagedAfter all of this drama there are now a few questions that Google needs to answer1 What was the need for a stability update when things were running just fine2 Why are only pixel 4a in certain countries eligible for a free battery replacement and other programs3 Why did you delete all the software updates prior to this one4 If you knew this update was going to severely affect the phones battery why did you go ahead with it5  and most importantly Why do you want Google Pixel 4a off the market because lets be real all of these are just tactics by Google to get rid of Pixel 4a  The ConspiracyHere are a few reasons I can think of why all of this might be happening1 Fault with Pixel 4a Battery in production Google might have realized that there were some faults with the batteries they installed in 4a and in the future these phones might cause serious hazards or worse blow up2 Getting rid of Lifetime Unlimited Backup Storage Google Pixel 4a is one of last phones by Google that supports Lifetime Unlimited Google Backup Storage for photos and videos Out of all the phones by Google that supports unlimited storage Pixel 4a might be the most active one no sourceMy VerdictGoing forward I dont have a lot of trust in Google Phones Contrary to where I stand today I vouched a lot for Google Pixels before I even convinced a few of my relatives to buy Google Pixel As far as my Pixel 4a is concerned I think Ill opt for the 50 optionAnyone with Google Pixel 4a please share your experienceHeres a Youtube video with some more information on this subject

they always have seemed to be quite responsive I played around with a few of the newer ones recently in store and liked the design and software What are some of the things you miss after switching What are some of the reasons you chose to switch One of my main concerns is I am a big privacy buff and I am not sure how privacy friendly a Pixel can be without some custom adjustmentsEDIT damn so many replies wow just adding this here which may change a lot of responses  I use 2 MacBook pros for work 2 jobs  and I will NOT compromise on that I just do not believe that any other laptop gets the job done as well and ages better than a MacBook I also have an Apple Watch Ultra 2 I wear 247 however I have considered replacing it with a whoop I am deeply in the ecosystem however I do see the

from Airpods Pro user.August 10 2022 update I have returned my Pixel Buds Pro so I will not be updating this thread Some of the reasons for doing so Transparency mode is a big deal for me And while they are pretty good on the PBPs the AirPods Pro still stand unmatched I rely on this I guess Im spoiled on them too as I wear them almost all the time when out and about and feel very constricted and not enough sound comes through like on the Airpods It also has very aggressive wind cancellation so while walking out and about it will just basically block all sounds out of one ear Quite often I will toggle the modes just to find out if I am truly in ANC or transparency mode Price If I was newly buying them and didnt already have the Airpods then it would be a no brainer But for what they are currently I was hoping for a significant upgrade over the Airpods I prefer better transparency at the expense of shittier call quality Also after switching back to the APPs I really have enjoyed the sound quality overall things sound fuller and just better Sorry Im not a sound engineer so I cant break things down specifically Paying 294 CAD for these just arent feasible and I will be looking out for deals in the future or purchasing second hand if deals come by Future features The spatial audio and 5 band EQ sounds nice but its not here yet Ive learned my lesson being a Pixel fanboy up until now that its better to wait it out and purchase after the features have been releasedx200BFYI I make updates to this post frequently I am glad to hear this review has helped so many and that fueling

withx200BHere goes ratings are relative to experience with Airpods Prox200BANC is pretty great Everything around me is quiet Standing beside a blender is similar if not better than the APPs 1010Transparency mode on the other hand still feels a bit muffled Dont get me wrong it certainly beats what I had with the WF1000XM4s or their canned counterparts But still nowhere near the APPs It is easily dealt with though and will possibly get better over updates so Im hopeful 710x200BAudio quality Im no audio engineer so please take this for my own amateur opinion They are leaning to the

frequency knocks my eardrums out That is unacceptable Im knocking it down to 410 for that ANOTHER EDIT it seems like the only app that is giving these issues currently is YouTube I tested this by comparing a music video on YouTube and the same one in the YouTube Music app They sound completely different YouTube music sounds well balanced Sound quality on YouTube music so far is now 910 If youre a YouTube music subscriber you can test these out for yourself here are the two links Disclaimer it is Pakistani music but youll appreciate the difference regardless Youtubehttpsyoutube5Eqbj3FDA YT Musichttpsmusicyoutubecomwatchv5Eqbj3FDAfeatureshareNew Phone call quality With the APPs Ive had issues with people not being able to hear me clearly while outdoors Ive also had issues where wind will cut out what the other person is saying The following are a few situations Ive tested with the Buds and my rating for each Note that I wait a while to ask the person on the other end about call quality and they initially have no idea that I am using a new headset so that I could get an accurate response I then follow to ask them how the quality is and then ask them to closely monitor the call following that as well All these situations are rounded into the ratings I give at the end Indoors quiet environment As you can imagine they are 1010 People can hear me clearly with no fuss and I can hear them 1010 APPs 1010 Indoors in lobby of my building people walking about and security making their usual calls and such Again people can hear clearly and I can hear them Zero issues After asking they had no idea I was walking about nor around people Not the case with the Airpods but at least they didnt hinder the call at all 1010 APPs 810 Outdoor walking wind and dogs barking I couldnt believe the clarity of the calls I had I could hear people perfectly Even with wind people could hear me clearly as well When I asked about quality they said they could hear me clearly with no fuss at all Didnt have to repeat a thing which was quite often the case with the Airpods 1010 APPs 610For the following its worth noting I drive a 2008 Hyundai Sonata on all seasons in Toronto Hopefully this remotely gives you an idea of road noise as it is hard to explain Driving on highway 95kmhr windows fully down worst case People struggle to hear me clearly This was expected The crazy thing is that I can still hear them crystal clear For what its worth I give them an 610 APPs 210 Driving on highway 95kmhr windows down to moderate level People can now hear me while not perfect but good enough to carry on a conversation with a few repeated sentences I couldnt do this with the APPs 810 APPs 410 Driving on highway 95kmhr windows fully up AC on I used to have an issue with the AC fan and the Airpods and people would not be able to hear me great and I kept hearing them cut out No longer an issue with the Pixel Buds I could hear people crystal clear and after asking people knew I was driving but it didnt get in the way of the conversation itself Never once had to repeat 1010 APPs 610x200BFit and feel I had the comply foam tips on the Airpods but I would feel comfortable even with the original silicone tips With the Pixel Buds Pro not so much They are miles ahead of the A series however since those wouldnt even stay in my ear for more than 3 seconds I will be getting a set of Complys for the Pixel Buds Other than this they fit in my ear quite well and sit flush within the canal I also love that I can flip the case opened and closed as easily as I could with the APPs case so yes its a fidgeters dream The openclose feel is just as solid as the APPs as well 710x200BFeatures I love being able to control volume from the swipe controls That cannot be done with the APPs and something that I have longed for I also love the ability to customize if I want to switch between two or three modes ANCTransparencyeverything off Also being able to use Google Assistant directly from Buds without hotword is amazing It would have been nice to have some sort of stem though since everytime I swipetouch I feel a bit of pressure on my ear and can hear the swipe motion in my drum

Pixel devices but this subreddit has so many negative posts about overheating battery life etc and it just becomes exhausting at some point Pixel devices are growing in popularity and there are many reasons for that The cameras the UI the software features the ecosystem integration etcetera are all reasons that I stay Im not even somebody that thinks Samsung devices have bloatware the S23 Ultra is a phenomenal phone and all of the apps that are construed as bloatware on here are generally easy to uninstall disable or hide without affecting performance whatsoever I just prefer the Pixel launcher over OneUI It looks cleaner more sleek and its a good middle ground between Samsung and AppleI know others have had similar posts in the past but some extra positivity never hurts in my opinionWhy do you stay with Pixel Have you had any significant issues with your Pixel devices Im genuinely curious to hear whyFor me I switched from an iPhone 11 to a Pixel 6 Pro and the UI just felt right to me the cameras were amazing and the phonecamera software tricks were genuinely beneficial to my day to day life The only issue I had was having to restart my phone once to get my phone paired to my sisters vehicle on a family road trip hardly anything to complain about Then I got the Pixel 7 Pro which has been just as good as the 6 Pro but more refined The camera colors are even more true to life and again I e only encountered one minor issue I brought it out kayaking with me one day this summer when it was about 90F and I was running the camera a lot after about 15 minutes it did say that it was running warm and camera quality may reduce while it cools down It wasnt ideal at the time but it wasnt a deal breaker for me and thats because the overall experience is so much better than what other phones have to offer me Ive got the Pixel Fold now and I genuinely have no complaints about it its a splendid device I guess app optimization from third parties could be improved but thats not Googles fault and Im seeing apps improve weekly so Im not too worried about that Alongside that I have immersed myself in the ecosystem I have Pixel Buds Pro and ASeries as well as a Pixel Watch My whole family has switched from iPhone and Motorola to Google and Samsung and I cant think of a single major complaintEveryone is going to have different experiences and if its not your flavor of phone thats fine My comment about using the phone incorrectly wasnt fair EditSo again why do you stick with Pixel","54":"USAILH Vega 56 iPhone 7 128 Pixel XL 32 Apple Watch S3 GoPro H3 BE W Paypal.Hi

Pixel 3a to iPhone 12 mini.TLDR Missing the customizable features of my Pixel Im not super techy just a regular person My very techy brother in law convinced me to switch back to Apple because of Googles dataprivacy concerns Here are all the things I miss about my Pixel1 The split screen function is by far the thing I miss most Loved having my Google Maps and Spotify both visible while driving2 The vibrancy of photos3 Being able to set my phone down without worrying about scratching the camera4 Customizable widgets ex Not having to open my calendar app to see whats on the schedule today or a weeks worth of weather at a glance 5 My custom launcher  an app drawer that was automatically alphabetical 6 Custom app icons7 How quickly my Pixel turned on from being dead 8 The doubleclick to open the camera9 Its heavier 10 Fingerprint sensor feels quicker and less invasive than FaceID 11 The autotranscript feature of the recorder app12 Adding new contacts took one less step 13 The cursor function was easier to use and place in the middle of a word14 I have both Safari and Chrome now which is irritating15 The notifications panel was more useful on my Pixel16 I dislike the super colorful app dock above the keyboard on my iPhone and miss having a custom colored keyboard17 A HEADPHONE JACK18 Wireless charging is a joke19 Being able to use a Spotify playlist for my alarm Things I do prefer about my iPhone1 I can bring it in the shower 2 Bluetooth connects more seamlessly3 Friends know how to use my phone if needed4 QR codes are easier to scan5 More gigs of storage space","56":"iPhone to Pixel.Finally the transition is done from 14 pro to pixel 9 pro xl and Apple Watch 7 to watch 3 Loving it so far No nuances except the WhatsApp transfer ","57":"Some early thoughts after getting a chance to play around with both the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro.I drove by a TMobile store and decided to check and see if they had the new Pixels on display which they did they also had a section for the Pixel Watch but it was not on display yet  The models they had on display were a Pixel 7 in obsidian and a Pixel 7 Pro in hazelFirst off as someone who generally prefers smaller phones I loved the size of the Pixel 7 but as someone who also values screen and cameras I dont feel too much regret in going with the Pixel 7 Pro knowing the upgrades I am getting with itThe hazel color definitely is going to be one of those colors that looks very different in different lighting sources as in the store the gold metal looks way more silver and the green definitely looked more greengrey  Even the picture I took with my S22U looks slightly more vibrant than the color I saw in the store  httpsimgurcoma3qGQjSW  I still think its a great color but I have a feeling a lot of people may end up disappointed due to how different it might look to them once they get it One positive is unlike the obsidian Pixel 7 you could barely see any fingerprints on the hazel colorOne other thing I wanted to compare were the two screens First off at 100 brightness and adaptive brightness turned off the Pixel 7 Pro was significantly brighter than the regular Pixel 7 so even though Google claims them to have the same regular brightness with only peak being slightly higher on the Pixel 7 Pro this isnt the case and therefore I would not be surprised if peak brightness is going to be much further off than just 100nits The Pixel 7 Pro was actually as bright as my S22 Ultra however because I was inside I couldnt compare the two when it comes to peak brightness  One last thing about the screens is I was impressed that both the regular Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro have virtually the same color temperatures and black level performance with both looking great This is something Samsung doesnt do as I have both the S22 and S22U and the colors and blacks look very different between the two panels with the S22U looking far better than the S22Lastly I played around with the cameras on the Pixel 7s a bit I was really impressed with the 2X mode as since its a crop in of the fantastic 50MP primary sensor I didnt even really feel much need to use the macro mode as from the couple shots I tested in 2X this gave me super sharp details through the entire image so if you are concerned to be missing the macro mode on the regular Pixel 7 I believe in most cases taking a step back and using the 2X zoom setting will get you something very similar as long as you dont need to get ridiculously close Of course even with this the ultra wide is so much wider on the Pixel 7 Pro honestly its quite disappointing how narrow the field of view is on the regular Pixel 7 The 5X on the Pixel 7 Pro looked great from what I could tell with sharp details and the 10X setting looked almost as good My only complaint with the 10X setting is that its a bit cumbersome to activate since the camera only lists 05x 1x 2x and 5X and you have to pinch to zoom to get to 10X I hope Google considers an option to add the 10X option as a toggle as well given it operates as a crop in of the telephoto sensor and isnt a digital zoom levelAs someone who hasnt owned a Pixel since the Pixel 3 I am excited to see if Google can win me back from Samsung  I am definitely a bit nervous to give up many of the Samsung features I have become dependent on One Hand Operation Good Lock DeX and overall greater customization of the launcher such as folders in the app drawer and more but I am also loving the idea of getting back Now Playing Call Screening and an overall more reliable camera experience  I guess I will find out in a few days","58":"Pixel 7 overheating.My pixel 7 gets so hot even while doing normal stuff sending messages browsing the internet watching videos Anyone else experiencing the same issueedit activating the SAFE MODE seems to fix the issue for now No heating after activating safe mode and restarting my phone","59":"Im returning my Pixel 8 Pro.Ill get right into it Im returning my Pixel 8 pro I dont want to be labeled as a Pixel hater so I want to make sure there is some context I have been a Google phones fan since the Nexus days I bought the Nexus 4 5 and 6P Then when pixel came a long I bought the Pixel 6 7 7 pro and now 8 Pro I LOVE the Google software I love the features such as live translate the feature that tells you what song is playing and the advanced Google assistant I also like the haptics which makes typing a pleasure Finally the camera is amazing HOWEVER all of this isnt enough to make me keep the phone The Pixel 8 pro at the end of the day is a phone and it is not good at phone things The problems weve seen in the past overheating battery draining and bad cell reception are all here still The cell reception one is awful My wifes s23 ultra will have 5g with no issues and mine cant even load pictures on X That causes the phone to heat up and the battery to drain The battery is inconsistent Some days I got 7 hours SOT Somedays I struggled to get 4 hours The overheating happens all the time whether maps is running or Im just watching a YouTube video As a result the phone feels slow a lot more than Id like from a phone this high end These issues are critical to using a phone and the pixel 8 pro is just not good at them Also I too have the issue where the text appears pink or yellow instead of white on AOD which affects the top or side of the display And finally the scrolling on Reddit is horrible At the end of the day this phone was the phone Ive been waiting for all year However it needs a better chip Tensor G3 is a failure in my opinion The AI features are awesome but they are not enough to make this phone worth it I look forward to the pixel 9 Ill be buying it and hoping they fix this years issues Peace ","60":"24 hour review w a Pixel 7 by a very basic user.Love it Theres a lot of reviews for and from professionals Lots of complaints about certain elements Heres a simple one from an amateur who uses the more basic phone features 24 hours in Upgraded from a P5 1 SIZE My biggest concern Was worried the 7 would be too large Not bad Definitely noticeably larger may not keep it in my pocket as much but all said I can live with it 2 SCREEN Colors are crisp screen looks good They tell me it gets brighter than the p5 but at max brightness in daylight looks the same to me For me NBD 3 BATTERY Another concern My p5 was a beast So far been up for 14 hours made a few calls BT connect to Galaxy watch browsed reddit for 3045 min a little social media played a round of wordle still at 57 I BRIEFLY snapped and edited a few photos but unless the battery gets worse after the break in period itll do just fine for me 4 OVERALL PERFORMANCEWay snappier Fingerprint on the front works well face unlock is a little jenky May need to spend more time on setting that up better But the phone zips No problems with phone calls Made 3 suburban and rural environments 5 If any other basic phone users have questions especially if youre coming from the p5 LMK I dig this phone","61":"Lets talk about the future of Pixel.Hello folks having lurked on this subreddit for quite a while now Id like to discuss the direction Pixel is headedI have a Pixel 2XL and I love it In fact Ive convinced my girlfriend best friend and another friend to switch to the 2 XL 23 of them were iPhone users I also convinced 2 other friends to get the Pixel 3 nonXL who were both  iPhone users I love the Pixel line and I hope this shows itHowever this last year has not been too good for the Pixel brand Lets go over itMemory management has been abysmal on the 3XL Im not sure what they changed compared to the 2 XL which doesnt seem to suffer these problems but they should have just done the same thing as before 4Gb is clearly not enough everyone knows it OnePlus having been offering 6Gb since the OnePlus 3 and Samsung now include 6Gb in the base model of the S10E The argument that Google can simply replicate performance in software is demonstrably limited The Pixel 4 should have 6Gb8Gb of RAM depending on storage config which well talk about in a moment and the Pixel 4 XL should have 8Gb of RAM Theres no excuse for such little RAM these days The Pocofone F1 also had 6Gb of RAM and thats a 300 phone so the excuse that it increases the price too much is incorrectOnePlus and Samsung now start their storage at 128Gb with Samsung also offering expandable storage The idea that because we have unlimited original quality photo backup to justify the 64Gb storage option simply doesnt fly in 2019 Why does Google assume its only photos that take up storage Although 64Gb is usually okay for me I dont see why other brands can offer more storage as the base model for a cheaper price Apps and games can easily push this to the limit I have Netflix and YouTube premium which means I can download content to watch while travelling but 64Gb is a limitation for me I think the Pixel 4  4 XL should come in 128Gb and 256Gb Pixel 4 128Gb should come with 6Gb of RAM whilst the 256Gb model should come with 8Gb of RAM As I said before the Pixel 4 XL should have 8Gb of RAM regardless This is just my opinion please feel free to disagree in the commentsBattery The 3XL has a smaller battery than the 2XL despite having more pixels to push  the 3 XL has 27 more pixels but the battery is 26 smaller Did they make a mistake and go the wrong way The S10 has a 4100 MaH battery many Huawei phones are above the 4000 mark even the OnePlus 6T has a 3700 MaH battery Again Googles philosophy that it doesnt need the best hardware because it can be matched in software is not good enough The battery life on the 3XL is simply not as good as on other phones period Apple has the ability to say that Google does not The Pixel 4 should have a 3100 MaH battery same as S10E and the Pixel 4 XL should have at least a 3800 MaH battery thats being generousThe design of the Pixel 3XL is actually not too bad The glass on the back feels nice and it feels a premium However if you hold a Samsung or iPhone of the same price it suddenly feels less premium This is subjective Id like to hear what you think Theres not much to say about the notch on the 3 XL except that it needs to go on the 4 XL Either a small notch like OnePlus 6 teardrop notch like OnePlus 6T or holepunch like Samsung S10 The bezels should also be shrunk my 2 XL feels a bit silly compared to the likes of some phones but please please make sure the frontfacing speakers are retained Just shrink them as much as possible whilst keeping the speakers please one of the best things about Pixel IMOLets talk cameras Again Google uses the philosophy that what can be done in hardware can be done in software To their credit they have proven this in the camera department I dont need to talk about how amazing they are at this They still use just a single rear camera which is fine However there are dual cameras on the front of the 3XL proving that they are aware some things are just done better with multiple cameras Its kind of a cool gimmick to say hey look what we can do with just a single camera but please its old just throw a second camera on the back and youll reclaim your position as camera king We get it you can do a lot with a single camera but if the user experience is better with dual cameras then please just do it A wideangle or telephoto would be great or just something to make portrait photos even better Regardless dual front and back cameras are necessary for the Pixel 4 XLObviously itll have waterproofing and wireless charging so thats fine and please please keep the squeeze for assistant I cant live without itIn screen fingerprint scanners are cool but unless you can make something significantly faster than whats in the OnePlus 6T and S10 please just keep the rear fingerprint scanner Its so much faster more convenient and swiping to see the notification tray is the best thing in the worldRegarding software I know this is more of an Android Q thing but please improve gesture navigation Its okay as it is but OnePlus and Apple do it so much better please just copy theirs just rip it Also I remember when the 2 was announced there were so many cool software features such as Now Playing Can we get more stuff like that with Pixel 4 They were so coolOh and fix some of the bugs with fast charging tooI know it sounds like Im complaining a lot and comparing it to other phones I really love the Pixel brand Ill be getting a Pixel 4 XL regardless so its not that I dont like Pixels Its just that when we spend so much money on a flagship phone I think Im entitled to expect a certain level of quality from the phone If youre offering something worse than the competition at a lower price then the Pixel brand will not survive They need to stop treating us as betatesters and more like actual customers I feel the whole Pixel team has some very amateur traits it would be great to see Google pull its socks up in 2019 and produce a phone that decimates the competition They have the talent the money and the resources The question is whether they want to treat Pixel owners with the same level of respect other OEMs do Well see I guessWould love to hear any other suggestions for Pixel 4 any changes over Pixel 3 and any points youd disagree with me on Thanks for reading I know its a long oneTLDR Pixel 4 needs to take hardware more seriously optimise better look better thats about itEDIT There seems to be a group of people going through every comment and autodownvoting Please stop it doesnt help the discussionEDIT 2 HOLY SHIT THANK YOU FOR THE GOLD First gold in my 4 years on Reddit thank you so much  EDIT 21 HOLY BALLS ITS CHRISTMAS THANKS FOR THE PLATINUM Feels great to know my opinion is being well received DEDIT 3 This post has got rather a lot of attention Does anyone know if its possible to organise an AMA with TeamPixel I think it would be beneficial to give them an insight into what the community is thinking I doubt they browse Reddit I mean OnePlus just finished a competition allowing anyone to submit new feature ideas for the OnePlus 7 so its not crazy to suggest that companies might be interested in what their users have to say Not sure if any of the mods can hook us up with this uXtorting uCorvetteCole uiiWoodstocK","62":"The Pixel 8 Pro seems popular it was almost sold at

Google Store employee I caught right after after he popped out from his break warned me that the phone I want might not be in stock because theyre low in stock I got a Obsidian 8 Pro 512GB but wanted

back up photos and videos to Google Photos for free for years Along the way I encountered a lot of issues while researching this topic so I wanted to share my current setup in hopes that this post helps someone BackgroundThe original Google Pixel released in 2016 came with a great promo any photo or video uploaded from the device does not count against your Google storage quota This means effectively unlimited Google Photos storage which is a huge perk for me since I take a lot of photos and videos 20k photos a year I record around 50100GB of media per month so for me this free storage is a lifesaverPhoto uploads from my other devices count against my storage quota so I want photos taken on my daily devices an iPhone 14 Pro a MacBook and a Pixel 7 Pro to be automatically copied over to my Pixel synced and uploaded to Google PhotosHeres how I do it Acquiring a Google PixelI bought mine off eBay for around 60 It must be the first generation pixel or pixel XL These models include unlimited full resolution photo backup Pixels generation 2 through 5 include unlimited storage saver backup which reduces photos to 16MP and videos to 1080pI recommend finding a 128GB model for more space and avoiding the Verizon model as those cant be rooted Pixel Device SetupSoftware Do a fresh install of the device Disable automatic OS and app updates Disabling OS updates isnt necessary because the Pixel doesnt receive any new software updates but it will avoid unexpected surprises Turn on Airplane mode disable notifications for all apps and turn on Do Not Disturb     Its important to manually disable notifications for all Google services This stops those Is this you trying to log in verification requests which cover the entire screen and interfere with scripts Disable emergency alerts Do not enable battery saverthis will stop Syncthing and Google Photos from running in the background Enable developer mode     Enable the Stay Awake when connected to power toggle     Enable USB debugging This is used for setting up screen sharing using scrcpy Reduce screen brightness to zero Root your device and unlock your bootloader        This would make my life a lot easier it gives a lot more options But sadly Im not able to root my device Verizon Pixels have a locked bootloader Otherwise Id mount an external drive using this scripthttpsgithubcommasterhaxpixelbackupgang to

Ignore Patterns was essential to avoid copying tmp and trash files Backing Up from MacI set up a shared folder that would copy random photos and videos from my Mac to the Pixel I used Syncthing for Mac I also tried Resilio Sync and both work fine I mainly use this to upload photos from my digital camera  just copy them directly into the shared folderSomething to keep in mind make sure to enable ignore file permissions in the advanced folder settings to avoid any file access issues Also set up ignore patterns so it doesnt copy over dotfiles those hidden files that start with a  Backing Up from iPhoneThis was the biggest challenge There were multiple options but none were great I did a lot of research to see how I could do this Some avenues I explored iPhone Simplest way Copy the photos manuallyCopy the photos from your iPhone to your computer then copy them to the Pixel You could also copy them to a shared Syncthing folder on the computer which would then forward the photos to the pixel This solution works well for people who dont take a lot of photos It also protects the Pixel device lifetime because you can turn off the phone when youre not copying photosAn improvement is to set up automatic photo backup on the iPhone to any cloud photo backup solution such as Microsoft OneDrive Amazon Photos iCloud Photos Dropbox or even another Google Photos account Have your iPhone automatically upload these photos to the cloud Then periodically download the photos to your computer from the cloud and copy them to your PixelIf you find the following methods too complicated just stick with this one It should be good enough for the majority of people The cons are it doesnt support automatic backup it involves an extra step and it takes a few minutes of time every month iPhone Resilio SyncI got this working the quickest and I used Resilio Sync for a few months to back up my photos Its easy to set up and works decently well Install Resilio Sync on the iPhone and Pixel create a camera roll backup and share it to the Pixel Resilio sync runs in the background of the pixel and it starts on boot But it has minor quirks I didnt enjoy the experience and eventually switched to something betterBenefits Free Easy to set up Works decently well out of the box Supports direct upload from iPhone to Android Doesnt require a serverWeaknesses Resilio Sync doesnt support automatic background photo uploads It only runs when the app is open I tried setting up shortcuts that would open the app when I connected the phone to a charger at home but this became annoying as it would only happen if the phone was unlocked Resilio Sync does not copy over Live Photos Resilio Sync does not handle burst photos correctly It will copy over the first photo in the burst and not copy the remaining photos To get Google Photos to back up my camera roll I had to manually copy an image into the backup folder so it would be detected The iPhones camera backup can be a bit quirky  it splits photos into separate folders with 1000 photos each DCIM  100APPLE 101APPLE 102APPLE etc I ended up adding a random image to the main DCIM folder to make sure Google Photos recognized everything including all the subfolders iPhone PhotoSyncI saw someone mention PhotoSync on Reddit and gave it a tryBenefits Automatic background backup Supports direct upload from iPhone to Android Polished appWeaknesses Paid app Automatic background backups are only available with the Premium plan which is a 20 onetime purchase On iPhone it only supports direct automatic backups to a PhotoSync server not other devices I could send individual files to the Pixel but I could not enable automatic backups to my Pixel I had to trigger them manually Requires a server for full functionalityAt the time I tried Photosync I did not have a home server Looking back in terms of ease I think it would work pretty well If I did this again and wanted an easy to configure paid option Id explore thisI ended up not using PhotoSync AlternativesI spent a lot of time researching how people copy their photos and came across the following options Amazon Photos Includes free unlimited fullresolution photo storage with a Prime membership but you only get 5 GB for video 5 GB was not enough so this is a nogo Microsoft OneDrive Photos Includes 5 GB by default and 10GB through referrals I saw someone online use thishttpswwwredditcomrGooglePixelcommentsnjk5b3ogpixelunlimitedphotosstoragesyncthingguidegz8yakm They would install the Microsoft OneDrive app on their iPhone enable automatic backups to the cloud then periodically download the photos from the cloud to their computer copy them to the Pixel and upload them to Google Photos It works but I wasnt sure how to automate thisNote you can acquire an additional 10GB of lifetime storage by buying referrals on ebay Dropbox Supports automatic background photo uploads and Live Photos Includes 2 GB by default but its possible to increase the storage by up to 18 GB via referrals This option looks very viable Upload photos automatically from iPhone download them offline on the Pixel then upload them to Google Photos Remove the photos when completed Instructions herehttpswwwredditcomrgooglephotoscomments13retq9iphonetopixelonegooglephotoautomationjnj7uqnI didnt explore this because I was already using Dropbox on my iPhone for file backup and didnt have enough space to manage photosNote Similar to OneDrive you can buy referrals on ebay for 16GB of lifetime storage Mounting a NAS folder using EasySSHFShttpswwwredditcomrGooglePixelcommentsugarqqjustboughtapixel1forunlimitedphotostorageitns9xf  Requires a rooted Pixel and a NAS Mount the remote drive in the DCIM folder of the Pixel Google Photos will think these files are on device and will automatically backup everythingThis doesnt work for me because I cannot root my PixelI ended up with the following setup Current Setup Traditional NAS  Immich  Tailscale  SyncthingThis option is a little complicated I have a homelab server running as a photo backup server The server runs Immichhttpsgithubcomimmichappimmich as a photo backup server and Tailscalehttpstailscalecom so I can connect to the server from my iPhone On my iPhone I installed Immich and the Tailscale app and set up the Tailscale VPN Immich automatically uploads my iPhone photos to the NAS then I collate the photos into one folder using a script and copy the photos to a Syncthing folder I then sync this folder to my OG Pixel and it backs up the same as my other devicesMore detailsI have an Ubuntu server running Portainer which hosts Immich Tailscale and Syncthing as Docker containers This was fairly easy to set up using templates I found online Immich A free selfhosted image server The immich UI is excellent I can individually select which albums to upload and it supports automatic background upload The con is that its a locally hosted service which is annoying to expose to the public internet Which is why I use Tailscale An easytouse personal VPN that allows my iPhone to connect back to my Ubuntu server without setting up port forwarding Free I run a Tailscale node on my Ubuntu server and enabled local network access Then I connected to Tailscale on my iPhone and I can see my Immich server via the Tailscale network Syncthing Basic file syncing app used beforeI asked ChatGPT to write a scripthttpspastebincomi2Nbsruv that copies files from my Immich library into my Syncthing folder every 5 minutes The script will only copy image and video files and will not copy already copied files The files are renamed to avoid potential naming conflicts Already copied files are marked in a separate file to avoid copying photos multiple times I set up the script to run as a systemd service which runs on boot and executes every 5 minutesSyncthing then copies the contents of this folder to my Pixel and it works as normal For the Syncthing folder I set it so that it was send  receive and enabled ignore file permissions Immich my current setupBenefits Free and open source Very configurable  I can choose which albums to upload Supports Automatic background uploads from iPhoneWeaknesses Requires a home server and mild technical ability to set one up Automatic backup works great when Im on home wifi but when Im traveling I need to enable Tailscale VPN to have it backup When Tailscale is enabled it kept trying to backup over cellular data tailscale makes the backup server appear to be on the local network I had to disable cellular data in the Immich app settings Immich is under active development and I need to update the Immich server about once per month manually Occasionally there are breaking changes and I need to update the docker config file Automatically Freeing Up Space using the Automate apphttpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomllamalabautomateGoogle Photos has a feature that frees up backedup photos I saw someone using the Automate app to do thishttpswwwredditcomrAutomateUsercommentsghu9e6howdoirungooglephotosfreeupspaceaction Basically it opens up the Google Photos app and clicks through the screen to the Free up space menu and selects it Its set to run every morning at 8 amThe version shared a few years ago broke due to UI changes so I reimplemented it Heres an image of the flowhttpsiimgurcomazw8DQXpng if youd like to implement it yourself It opens google photos clicks through the menus to the Free up space button and presses it Freeing Up Storage on AndroidWith Syncthing if the sync folder is configured as Send  Receive theres no need for this Once photos are backed up and freed up on the Pixel the copy on the Android phone is removed as well This works fairly well Freeing Up Storage on iPhoneIts annoying but I found two ways to do this1 Open the Google Photos app then find the checkbox to select all photos in a month In the menu choose the option Delete device original This will delete the copy of the photos on your phone If you try to delete photos that are not backed up the app will warn you2 Using the Free up storage feature This button only shows up if you have the Backup photos option enabled But if you turn on backup itll start uploading your photos  which you dont want To get around this first turn off WiFi on your iPhone Then enable backup Since youre not connected to WiFi the backup wont actually start Now the Free up storage option will appear  just click it and run the process The Free up storage feature doesnt work that great it keeps a lot of already backedup photos Connecting Remotely AdvancedIts useful to debug issues from the Pixel remotely I use a combination of adb and scrcpy to screen share my Pixel to my server Then I added a VNC viewer so I could view my server screen from my laptop This lets me view and control my Pixel from my laptop without touching the deviceI set up adb vnc and scrcpy on my server I set up adb using aptget I set up a VNC server following instructions on ChatGPT and connected to it from my laptop For scrcpy I followed the installation instructions herehttpsgithubcomGenymobilescrcpyblobmasterdoclinuxmd Then on my Pixel I enabled USB debugging in developer settings I connected my Pixel to my server via a USBC cable and verified I could see my Pixel in adb devices Then I ran scrcpy on my server which appeared in VNC and I could control my phone without being physically next to it This was very useful to fix various issues completely from my laptop Known Issues iPhone Live Photos appear as a picture and a 2 second video on Google Photos its an annoyance it bothers me but its not a dealbreaker This feature works on photos uploaded from the iOS google photos app Internal flash memory degradation The internal flash memory will wear out after a large number of writedelete cycles After a lot of use writes to device storage will start failing I found two possible ways to alleviate this     Mount an external USB drive as a local drive  see the setup here  httpsgithubcommasterhaxpixelbackupgang Requires root a USB hub and a USB drive     Mounting a network drive folder using EasySSHFS  Requires a rooted Pixel and a home server  NAS Maps a network drive to a local folder allowing backup Ive personally found SSHFS unstable so Id go with the external USB setup     If the device isnt rooted I dont know a way to alleviate this Battery health My Pixel battery is dying and lasts about 5 minutes away from power Ive looked into replacing the battery but read its a difficult replacement because theres a 50 chance I break my screen when opening up the phone This risk was too high to meThere is a battery replacement guide

phone is set to always on necessary for the Free up Storage script to run Google Photos folder detection Google Photos only lets you add a backup folder if theres already a photo inside of it Add a junk photo to the folder so Google Photos detects it If I did it again what would I doFirst Id purchase a rootable Pixel device nonVerizon then root it Id attach an external USB drive to avoid flash degradation and use the same Syncthing setup This enables backup from my Android and MacFor iPhone backup if I didnt have a home server I would investigate the dropbox route Id buy an additional 16GB storage on ebay I personally have never tested this setup but it sounds decently robust and should work Its unclear how easy this is to automateIf I had a home server Id go with my current setup Closing ThoughtsThis was a lot of work to set up Was it worth it Yes I have several TB of media on Google Photos and it would cost over a hundred of dollars per year to pay for normallyHow long will this work for This will work as long as Google Photos supports Android 10 the last update available for the Pixel which is probably at least til 2026 7 years after the release of Android 10 When Google drops support Ill find an alternativeThere are modified Android ROMs that include unlimited photo backup by pretending to be the original Pixel I looked into setting this up by emulating one in Genymotion However I didnt go this route because I already have a Pixel and its possible to detect these modifications and get my google account banned Extra links Information about rooting and

from a strong advocate of headphone jacksoriginally meant as a reply to uthoriumdioxide but I figured others might want to see thisI also was using a Galaxy Watch Active 2 to keep track of the workout so essentially had 3 bluetooth devices connected Or is the masterslave connection still a thing but its cleverly workedaroundPros These are my first wireless audio device of any kind and I will say getting rid of the wire is nice especially for exercise They have almost no weight to them compared to my usual overear headphones its easy to forget youre wearing them and theyre incredibly comfortable Google Assistant and touch controls is fantastic I know everyone else bought headphones that can do this years ago but being able to shuffle an album turn up the volume playpause or text somebody without stopping to look at my phone is life changing It can also pick up my Hey Google easily even when the wind is rushing past I can wear a helmet again instead of my headphones safety bonus They sound great Not an audiophile but I think these are incredible for such a tiny packageCons On my hourandahalfish cycling trip there were unfortunately a lot of little hiccups Im not sure how much of it was caused by external interference or complete incompetence on my part likely the latter but Ill break it down    Although you can listen on either bud I still feel like theres possibly a masterslave connection going on here with the right and left buds respectively If I cup a hand over the right bud the left one stops working If I cup a hand over the left bud the left bud also stops working Maybe Im misinterpreting this cant be sure It starts up again immediately when the hand is removed I first noticed this when going to pause the music and the signal dropped out Still have this problem even when only my finger is touching it Could this have to do with wearing a helmet Not as easily reproducible just sitting here at my desk I thought they advertised I could walk x number of feet away from my phone and they would still work If theyre cutting out at 2 to 3 feet I dont know what to think    Quite a few times during the trip the connection seemed to cut out briefly just randomly always the left bud and always slightly jarring    I mightve been imagining it but I think for a few minutes during the latterhalf of the workout the left bud slightly was louder than the right one throwing me off balance a bit Its all cleared up now however    Interestingly enough at one point they completely quit working altogether but Im not convinced it was entirely their fault I was about 7 miles north of home and both buds suddenly cut out making the disconnection chime I struggled to connect them for about 10 minutes clear pairing rebooting phone etc then eventually gave up and resorted to cycling home in silence However relocating by 100 yards seemed to do the trick and they continued functioning afterwards First guess is that I wandered into some sort of unknown 24GHz bluetoothjammingmegadeadzone but my Galaxy Watch was connected just fine the whole time so I cant say Maybe Ill go back to that spot and see if they disconnect again The Assistant cant tell me what the battery level of the buds is instead vocally redirecting me to the app A minor thing though for sure but annoying while on a bike Not sure how much they can do about this since hardware limitations are a thing and the fact that something this small sounds this good and even exists in the first place is a a miracle of engineering in my outsiders opinion but a slight buzzing is definitely noticeable in the background of quieter audio Full disclosure Im a hobbyistpianist blursed with perfect pitch and known by family members to have extremely sensitive hearing but terrible red green colorblindness if that makes up for anything Doesnt bother me much but its there After wearing overear headphones for so long I forgot that windnoise is something you hear while cycling but theres nothing actionable about that so  Overall though its been a positive experience and I dont regret getting them Im sure the software experience and stability will improve over time maybe thats why they waited so long to launch When all is said and done Im still glad that the headphone jack is an option for athome listening on my Pixel 3a and I still resent a certain company for making dropping the headphone jack into an industry trend especially when bluetooth has demonstrated to me tonight that its not ready for primetimeWould recommendTLDR Theyre pretty great a bit glitchy at times but definitely worth it in my opinionEdit a word","70":"Brother can unlock pixel 8 pro with facial recognition.I watched dave2ds video yesterday where one of his main talking points was about how the pixel 8 pro had a much better face unlock that actually has the capability to get into more secure apps After I set up my 8 pro today and got home my brother who I bought the pixel 7 pro for last year picked up my phone to look at it and he can unlock it every time with his face my face works perfectly fine as well i think we have some of the same facial features but we both look very differentJust to make sure I wasnt going insane I set up my face on his p7p and it would not let him unlock it until he retrained it to his face I just find it funny that they say now the more secure unlock feature will let him into my bank account no problems but his p7p wouldnt even let him get past the lock screen x200B","71":"Pixel 6 Pro vs Samsung S21 Ultra Snapdragon Actual Comparison.Alright Ive been comparing the two side by side for about a day now and there are some GLARING differences that I have not heard mentioned or seen in reviews I dont know how its possible since if you compare side by side its incredibly obvious but here we goTo set the stage Ive owned every Pixel since the 2 except for the 5 Have owned OP 7Pro and S21 Ultra the last few years in between and was extremely excited about Google finally making a flagship Sadly I think they fell short except for the camerasx200B Display    This isnt even close The S21 Ultras display is much brighter and clearer than the P6 Pros When I watched a 1440p side by side video on YouTube the S21s 14 brightness is the P6s 34 brightness Not to mention the video just looked better    You really have to dial up the brightness on the P6 At 50 brightness it looks like it is still in dim mode    No way to change between HD FHD or QHD on P6 How is this possible Fingerprint sensor    I dont know how more people arent shaming Google for putting in an optical sensor rather than ultrasonic The speed of the ultrasonic on the S21 and being able to unlock the phone even when the phone is completely locked and the screen is blank is fantastic On P6 you have to tap to wake then literally push your finger down on the phone while a giant flashlight scans your finger to unlock it much slower than S21 At night when in bed this is an issue if my partner is trying to sleep and there is constantly a flashlight turning on and off when I need to unlock my phone This is almost unforgivable IMO    No option to turn off unlock animation not even in developer options Can turn it off on S21 easily    Speaking of unlocking no face unlock on P6 Oye General performance    Ive seen speed tests where both phones are neck and neck Im not sure how because every task I have done side by side the S21 loads faster and feels faster Buffering on YouTube is almost nonexistent when you are skipping ahead whereas every time you do that on P6 it buffers and has to load for a quick second Power button placement above the volume rocker on P6    How did this get approval in the first design stages Its a little thing that is such an easy fix but now its in an awkward not easy to use place since your finger rests where the volume keys are Gyroscope on the P6 is very slow    Going into landscape mode on anything has a 1  2 second delay where the S21s is almost instant Cameras    P6 Photos look great but I dont think its because of the new sensor yet They look very similar to old P5 photos in good conditions    Night photos look better if you dont turn on nightsight on P6    Video is pretty equal between both This is where Google has probably noticeably progressed the most    The ultrawide on P6 can barely be called that Not sure why they chose such a narrow sensor when using all new hardware Battery    Ill need to keep using P6 to see how the adaptive battery works but out of the box it is sad to see that even with Google Tensor there seems to be a lack of optimization Stock Android 12 vs Samsung One UI Beta Android 12  I like the design of stock Android but some simple functionality hinders it and makes simple tasks annoying    Wifi toggleare you kidding me Google Sometimes I wonder if you actually test your phones or just throw stuff in there halfbaked    Volume toggle  on P6 you have to click the volume rocker click the sound profile button and then select if you want it to be on silent vibrate or volume on On Samsung you pull down the task bar and click through which one you want So much better    Brightness control  you have to swipe down twice on stock Android where its already there on Samsung and at the bottom of the phone now    No double tap to sleep on P6 This has been around on my LG phone from like 7 years ago what are you waiting for Google    Ataglance on P6  Google how can you not let me turn this off on my homescreen I want to use another Google widget I love instead but this never leaves the top left corner    Google search bar on homescreen on P6  Isnt it about time Google let us take this out and use more of the homescreen for what we want    No quick shortcuts on lockscreen of P6 Two on S21 in bottom corners    Google stop making us install 3rd party launchers to fix your poor design choices If you havent noticed the people who buy and support Pixels are techies who love as many options as possible Maybe this is the point to appeal to the masses but you havent earned that hardware business model yet     Why cant we build folders in the app drawer on P6 to make things all nice and clean Final thoughts    Tensor seems to be more marketing than anything at this point except for a couple of handy tools like speech recognition and magic eraser which Im sure will come to Google Photos at some point and be widely available    Google makes great strides and then they completely blowout a hammy in the last quarter mile of a race with really bad mistakes on design functionality etc Who beta tests these phones honestly    P6 Pro will continue to get better and better as more updates come out Im sure But Google really needs to pay more attention to what competition is doing and understanding what people really like in other Android skins Im not sure if its stubbornness or honest oversight but they have to get better    Isnt it time Google got on a better calendar cycle when releasing hardware Now with Tensor they shouldnt be constrained Stop releasing at the end of the year and get in the game with Samsung S22 will probably be EVEN faster than the S21 already is and thats only 34 months away    They call it the Pixel 6 Pro but feels like there is room for a Pixel 6 Pro Plus The pricing is great for these phones but Id gladly pay a little more to not have to deal with obvious shortcomings that are easily solvable by better hardware    Samsung has come incredibly far with One UI Its like they actually listen to customers and offer a pretty close to stock experience while only adding beneficial tweaks and software improvements If Samsung stopped preloading their own homegrown apps like Galaxy Store Bixby Samsung Internet Samsung Cloud etc and let people make their own choices it would be hard to ever chose Pixel over Samsung at this point IMO    Google if you want a beta tester Please let me know Edit Not being able to remove the arrow in the bottom left on GBoard on Pixel is extremely annoying Samsung lets you hide that but I cant find anything that says stock Android lets you Someone please correct me if Im wrongEdit 2 You cant turn off 5g connection if you are using Google Fi Edit 3 I realized that Im running the beta of One UI Need to compare stable version when its released but Samsung is still flying comparing to P6Edit 4 For people giving Google a pass on going optical instead of ultrasonic heres what S21 is capable ofhttpsyoutubecomshortsjfzYtClVIEfeatureshareEdit 5 Cant use Brave browser Seems like its not supported yetEdit 6 Have initiated a return of the P6 Pro and sticking with my S21 Ultra","72":"Chose the Note 8 over the Pixel XL 2 XPost from rGalaxyNote8.Chose the Note 8 over the Pixel XL 2 Ive been humming and hawing for weeks trying to decide what my next phone should The Note 7 was my first dip into the world of android but sadly had to return it So I turned to the Pixel XL and man did I love that phone So fast forward a year later Ive got a chance to upgrade so I narrow it down to the XL2 and the note 8 I watched every review imaginable on YouTube followed all the leaks read all the hands on reports and decided to wait till the official Google event despite leaning towards the Note Low and behold the event came and literally that night I went out and got the note 8 It felt like Google pushed me towards Samsung It just didnt make sense Where I live the Pixel XL2 is priced at 1289 and the Note 8 at 1299 Were talking a 10 difference For me 10 is well worth the better water rating the expandable storage the much superior screen AND the headphone jack And lets not forget that wonderful wonderful spen I could care less about dual speakers and honestly after a couple days I dont see this Samsung experience being nearly as bad as people claim and thats coming from someone who just left stock android And even the fingerprint scanner location isnt that awful either its not as convenient as the one on the pixel but again after a few days of retracing muscle memory its fine No complaints The biggest difference Ive seen so far is battery life My God the battery life on this thing is just unreal On my Pixel XL I was averaging 10 hrs off the charger with 3 hrs SoT That would have my battery hovering around 25 Ive reset the phone played with every setting imaginable but that was still the average Yesterday I decided I was going to go hard on my Note 8 and see how much I could squeeze out of God damn About 18 hrs off the charger and 65 hrs of SoT Left me with 5 battery leave UNREAL My God I love this phone Why would any buy anything else Incase people are curious about what my settings were when I achieved this WQHD Always on Display on Bluetooth on AND connected all day to GearS3 2 hours of podcasts through Bluetooth headphones while still connected to GearS3 Max brightness Max location settings on NFC on Wifi on all day

since last chargehttpsiimgurcom1ImeJzWjpg Screen on TimehttpsiimgurcomrTjRZ65jpg Pretty sure thats everything TLDR The battery life on this thing is incredible The screen is stunning and the performance is smooth as silk Hands down the best android phone on the market right now Glad I went with the Note 8 over the new Pixel XL2 and it definitely destroys my previous Pixel XL ","73":"Pixel

dad imported from America  to the almost latest and greatest iPhone 11 Pro Max I couldnt imagine myself changing over to another ecosystem The casual its never failed me why should I changefeeling kept coming back But it was time to change My job gave me an iPhone 11 so I now had two iPhones in my pocket One which I could easily sell for 900 and another I got for free At the same time I didnt want to mix my work with any personal stuff on my phone  so I knew another phone was necessary   650 bucks later and my Pixel is here   One week has gone by and I just love it The feeling is something hard to explain in words you have to touch it IRL to understand If anything Id compare it to touching a brand new BMW 7series dashboard The premium plasticleatherfeeling is so comfy For me the screen looks justasgood as the iPhone My eyes cant really spot the difference The OLED screen is a big  as I watch loads of YTvideos before I go to bed The camera is good I mean there are probably better

think I will make the leap heres why.So I wanted to share my impressions as a deeply invested apple customer I think Im part of of a wave of apple people flirting with Google products and hoping sharing some insights might be helpful for others or at the very least deepen some conversationPixel pros Call screening feature is amazing Have the phone ask what the call is about before you pick up an unknown number and it transcribes the sound into text and asks you if youd like to take the call or not  The transcription is seriously accurate and impressive Im a creative director and having feedback from meetings in text is so nice when relaying it to teams  Native g suite apps are just so much better than apples in most cases I love that I will never be prompted to apple maps or email again Google assistant isnt something I use much but it blows siri out of the water Siri would also force me to launch apple music instead of Spotify all the time etc No more  The home screen feels more like a computer I love that I can pin conversations or have Google display a world cup score while I cant watch it live  The finger print sensor is not great but appreciated What I appreciated more was that I can go into settings have the phone stay unlocked while connected to home wifidevices Simple and genius I travel alot and still use prepaid sims the refusal to go full esim has been great Notification management is so good App drawer even better Apple should just copy this out right USB C one cable Finally  Camera is compotenet and competitive The editing options are really where it shines above apple though The suggestions and smart features like unblur have so much potential  Having moments where you can adjust different volumes separately  Google feels like its learning some of my habits especially around commuting and photo management I especially like it when it warns me when my train is coming without promptingn it Subjective but it feels like an exciting switch The iOS experience hasnt changed much In alot of ways even with dynamic islands and widgets I still feel like Im still using the same phone from 12 years ago with better hardware  Great clipboard management  Cost The phone didnt break 1k That should be celebrated Where Apple is still shining stronger for me  The phone is nice but apple hardware still feels a step up The charging speed is lackluster and the face flops often on pixel Not too bothersome though  I feel like apples photo app feels more organized and clear I miss the apple keyboard space bar that allows you to glide through blocks of text easily The weather app felt much more thoughtful and robust  Facetime is still better than most other options for me Messaging felt more stable losing iMessage has created chaos in my group chats Its getting better now but the first few days were bumpy  Homekit is a tidier app though Googlenest smart home hardwareproducts seem way more useful Airpods are so seamless with iOS I will miss the full breadth of their feature set  car play ux is much better and universal then Android auto  iPhone cinimatic video is untouchable right now Google customer support has not been ideal The apple store experience is really hard to top Im worried about a future repairThe typography scaling on apple seemed more precise across apps Overall Im finding theres a sense of greater clever utility with the pixel It feels like its making my day more effecient My iphone just felt like this simple thing that just works and with super sturdy software I have one week left to return it but more and more I feel like this is a keeper My apple watch will be a dud but I believe my iPad will fill all other gapsCurious who else is on this journey and what your take is","78":"Using Pixel with a Mac.I cant believe Im saying this but I was so impressed by Mr Whose the Bosss  review of the Google Pixel Pro that Im ready to leave the iPhone behind and go for the Pixel 7 Pro  I was going to wait for the iPhone 15 but the price and features are so good it would feel like a crime to skip out on itHowever since Im a dev and I have to use a Mac for work I also have an iPad and and Apple Watch 2nd gen

at the Google Store in NYC on Monday.I live in NYC and have a Pixel 7 Pro Saw the ads for the free watch offer ending on the 16 so I walked into the usually dead Google Store in Chelsea in NYC around 4PM on a Monday to buy the new phone just a few days after it launched There was a line of people waiting to be looked at by Google Store workers So many people were buying the new 8 series phones The Google Store employee I caught right after after he popped out from his break warned me that the phone I want might not be in stock because theyre low in stock I got a Obsidian 8 Pro 512GB but wanted the Blue one He helped me do the trade in and the manager was so busy completing other trade ins and assisting customers that it took him forever to come over to complete mine Anyway I got my phone and a guy who said he is from from Australia was watching me and the Google Store guy chat and when he saw the trade prices I got he did a trade in of his own too just cuz he wanted the watch bonus Im telling you the 8 series will be successful Google did a great job with the free watch and free headphones offer Another lady from Korea also walked into the store when I was leaving and she was so happy when they told her she could get free Earbuds with the 8 lol Just really smart marketing from Google","86":"The Pixel 5 is the best phone Ive ever owned and Im going to be sad when its gone.I love my Google Pixel 5 Its honestly the perfect phone for me Back when the Samsung Note 7 released I picked one up and the phone was amazing The only gripe I had with the phone was that it was a tad bit too big for me Then of course the phone notoriously started catching flames and exploding so Samsung basically sent me a box that looks like it was supposed to contain a bomb and forced me to return my phone to them After that I had a Samsung S7 Galaxy Edge and simply put the downgrade from the Note 7 that I just lost in addition to the phone itself just not being what I really wanted and ended up being probably the worst Phone Ive ever owned worse than my LG env LG env 3 Motorola Rival and iPhone 44S not sure which I had here After my Samsung ended up breaking from drops I needed a new phone at a decent price The Pixel 5 was 700 at the time of purchase with a promotional 50 best buy gift card so I went in on itBest technology purchase Ive ever made This phone is such a beast at a perfect size and the back finger sensor is just so amazing The battery lasts forever even when playing OldSchool Runescape one of the main reasons I bought the phone It also has 5G capabilities and 5G is ridiculously fast for me when I have it My girlfriend still suffers from 4G LTE Her Samsung Note 10 barely fits in my pocket sometimes Its also an awesome phone for sure but Id argue that my Google Pixel 5 has more desirable features than her flagship Samsung Note at a notably cheaper price point The only downside I have with my phone is the lack of an earbud port but my girlfriend got me Google pixel buds for Christmas one year and they work great with the phone anywaysThen I saw the Pixel 6 and was honestly disappointed The phone is too big No more back sensor The camera bezel is kind of ugly to me I dont know why Google decided to randomly change their design At this point Im going to probably be buying the smallest and best smartphone on the market at a justifiable price and I hope Google returns to something similar like the Pixel 5 Its just such a great phone and Im going to be sad if and when my phone inevitably needs to be replaced if I dont still have a similar optionWith that said any recommendations for phones post Pixel 5 Is the Pixel 5a also good too I probably wont be buying a phone for a while but just want to know what other phone alternatives I should keep my eye on if the Pixel 789 etc continue the design trends of the Pixel 6Thanks for reading my love letter to the Pixel 5","87":"Pixel 8a is the best phone in years.The Pixel 8a 128gb is

the same year And as always the Samsung flagships wins with a clean slate besides cameras making pixels look like a bad purchase Then 2 months after release around nov or dec some of the major YouTubers do this yearly smartphone awards where they award phones in different categories Somehow Pixel phones since 2022 so basically since pixel 7pro manages to win best flagshipandroid or smartphone of the year android or is at least a really close contender And not to mention about the camera awards that even a budget pixels wins sometimes Im usually in xcom or threads tech space and I see people constantly complaining about everything So Im wondering with all the complains that people have about how these phones are lackluster and doesnt have enough performance and or how Google is doomed how it still manages to be at least at the top even with the underperforming chip than vast majority of the smartphones I mean with the hype that the 9 series is getting I wouldnt be surprised if they would be the favourites","95":"A regular users thoughts after using the Pixel 9 Pro for two months.Background of the purchase I had been using an iPhone but since my childs kindergarten activities required a recording device I found it challenging to find a suitable DV It seems that major companies are now focusing on smart phone recording devices After some research I was drawn to the Pixel 9 Pro for its 5x zoom lens video boost feature and Gemini and I also wanted to try the latest Android system So I decided to go with the Pixel 9 ProImpressive features1 The zoom quality up to 15x is quite good and the Video Boost feature is stunning perfectly meeting my needs for recording my childs kindergarten activities2 Gemini is incredibly convenient quick inquiries and responses from the local LLM are very efficient and its voice recognition capability is excellent3 I can use apps to block spam calls and texts Finally 4 The display is detailed and vibrant and various apps run very smoothly5 Six months of free Google One Gemini Advance provides me with an additional LLM service option Sometimes the answers from gemini advance are better than GPT4o6 Adding events and performing other tasks with Gemini Advance is very convenientAreas for Improvement1 First the Bluetooth is very disappointing I enjoy using Bluetooth earbuds while doing chores but if I move more than 5 meters from the phone the sound starts breaking up In my opinion reliable Bluetooth connectivity is a basic requirement for a smartphone and Pixel didnt meet this standard which is really unfortunate2 As a regular user I cant see much difference between 12MP and 50MP photos Plus you cant take continuous shots at 50MP which is frustrating when I need to capture multiple moments quickly3 Photos and videos can only be cast to a TV via Chromecast not Miracast I have a Chromecast 4K device a 4K TV and WiFi 6 but casting 50MP photos or 4K videos still appears blurry4 The Recent Apps gesture swiping up from the bottom fails frequently I like to close unnecessary apps and while this gesture is similar to the iPhones it often seems like the Pixel is actively blocking me from accessing Recent Apps5 Geminis responses are often too wordy and I typically only need brief answers Using prompts to refine responses leads to longer voice interactions which increases the risk of speech recognition errors6 Fingerprint unlock occasionally fails7 I cant remove the Google search UI at the bottom and the screenshot and search buttons in Recent Apps are also permanent As a regular user I dont need frequent search access8 The power and volume buttons are on the same side which makes it easy to press the wrong one9 The news recommendations on the leftmost screen of the home page cant be customized for another feature such as frequently used app predictions I dont like these news recommendations and can only turn them off rather than replace them with something more useful10 Theres no feature showing recommended apps based on my current context or historical usage dataReiterating I am just an ordinary user who doesnt enjoy gaming and only looks at my phone screen for about 30 minutes a day while using Bluetooth headphones to listen to audio for around 2 hours The issues Ive encountered might be due to individual device quality or possibly my lack of understanding of the proper usage methods","96":"My Pixel 7 Pro after one week.Hey everyone Im coming from an iPhone 12 and I gotta say Im super impressed with the phone so far The camera is outstanding especially the night shots The battery life is insane I was getting roughly 45 hours of on screen time and now I get roughly 89 hours For example I take my phone off the charger at 530 in the morning and by the time I put it on the charger at night Im left with 20 with streaming Spotify all day I work in a warehouse with earbuds in all day and watching YouTube on the way to work and back home and at lunch Overall I dont think Ill be going back to apple unless they come out with something that really breaks the mold but the higher refresh rate and different system os have been keeping me entertained","97":"Why the pixel 7a might still be a better buy in my opinion than the 7.I might get downvoted for this but I just wanted to share my opinion I know a lot of peoplereviews say that its better to just get the regular pixel 7 rather than the 7a but here is my point of viewperspective1 The original MSRP without factoring in any deals The price difference between the 7a and the regular 7 may seem small at only 100 but its still a significant amount By opting for the 7a you can use the extra 100 to purchase accessories like a case screen protector wireless charger or charger brick since its not included or even splurging on some earbuds you can get more value for your money2 You also get longer updates too with the 7a Pixel 7 is already seven months old and the software updates will only last until October 2025 already 24 years left with security updates until October 2027 which is a long time but the 7a will probably have longer updates since it was released later3 The 7a is much more durable than the 7 Based on a durability test video with the 7ahttpsyoutubezZJ0fwbbP8 compared to the 7 pro durability testhttpsyoutubernPPygtQHw Im assuming that the 7 has the same design build quality as the 7 proOverall the Pixel 7a is a better value than the regular Pixel 7 in my opinion It is cheaper has longer software updates and is more durable If you are looking for a great phone at a good price the Pixel 7a is the better option in my opinionEdit for reference I have the Pixel 4A 4G and these seems like a lot of upgrades for me for 100 less and I just got 7a at best buy for 450 brand new so 50 off MSRP and the same price when the pixel 6a when it was also brand new","98":"Question LDAC on Redmi Buds 6 Pro  Pixel 7.Hello there  I got my Redmi Buds 6 Pro yesterday and Im loving them thus far I came from the Redmi Buds 4 Pro which I unfortunately lost I have one issue with the 6 Pros though  These earbuds are advertised to have LDAC and I have seen posts where people talk about LDAC in these and screenshots where LDAC is shown in settings and whatnot However while I had access to LDAC on my 4 Pros and my Pixel 7 I cannot find it anywhere on my new earbuds either in the Xiaomi App or the earbuds settings page on my connected devices list I have them updated to their latest version  Has anybody had an issue like that before Is it maybe on but for some reason it does not show anywhere Can you suggest any way I can verify what is going on  Cheers","99":"Pixel buds pro  one week in.Ive just upgraded to a Pixel 7 Pro and took advantage of a 300 google store voucher to also upgrade my Jabra Elite active 65t earbuds to the pixel buds proAfter a week in I thought it would be helpful to share my early thoughts and see what others are experiencing the case is great feels premium and is a nice size for a pocket wireless charging is nice the fit of the buds is a bit strange I find these hard to get seated and they are nowhere near as secure as the jabra set ANC and transparency mode seem to work reasonably well but I have noticed in ANC mode that the audio bounces between each bud occasionally and I get a few weird audio artefacts There is a noticeable but mild ANC hiss  continuing on the ANC track whenever I put the buds in I inevitably put a finger over one of the external mics causing a high pitched feedback noise touch controls suck Not specifically on these earbuds just in general I miss the jabra buttons  multipoint switching between my work laptop and phone has been seamless and much better than the jabra  audio quality is bassier than the jabra set but overall not miles better This could be due to the fit  the system sounds when switching modes and taking actions are too similar and I have no idea whether ANC is off or on I would much prefer the assistant to just tell me what mode Im switching to  why can I only re bind one function Lots of earbud makers seem to take this path Its annoying having assistant read notifications is good in principle but Ive turned it off because I get emails Assistant reads the entire email and I get dozens per day If this was configurable it would be more useful So thoughts Are your experiences similar","100":"Pixel 7 after 1 year compared to 3.This might be a bit irrelevant since the 8 came out but Ive been using the Google Pixel 7 for exactly a year now and I want to compare it to my previous phone the Google Pixel 3 which is also in its 5 year anniversary I may or may not have gotten the Pixel 7 exactly 4 years after I got the Pixel 3 lol    Firstly the design is pretty good The camera row gives me Bender vibes It makes for a recognizable look but I miss the glossy top of the 3 Transferring my data was a breeze but thats to be expected The display and overall phone size was startling and the phone is pretty heavy with my case but I got used to it Sometimes I even use it to work out my arm  Theres just the bezel at the bottom of the screen thats bigger than the top one for some reason I have a screen protector so I dont want to even know how strong the Gorilla Glass is I did drop my 3 a couple times though and and it only ended up with one crack on one of the bottom corners so I would assume this ones stronger  The power button did fall out just around a week after I got this phone but I fixed it recently with the warranty so thats there    Display is great but it has this green tint when viewed from a weird angle I dont think my Pixel 3 had this But its not a problem at all 90 Hz refresh rate is apparently so smooth my friends pointed it out Maybe Ive just been used to it Couldnt care less about the notch or camera hole as long as I get more screen space Plus it makes for some creative wallpapers    Im not a camera person so this section will be brief The cameras are good enough to take pictures with zooms really far I dont know enough about cameras to really say Maybe theyre actually better than I think  The funny thing is the main reason I even got a new phone was because the single camera on the 3 randomly became blurry so its ironic I didnt write more on the camera When I get the chance to Ill try the other features like Cinematic Mode and the Photo Unblur    Im also not a audiophile so what I say might not be a complete review The audio quality is pretty okay but I do miss the front facing speakers on the 3 Yes I know theres a speaker at the top but its not that powerful I think its for when your phone isnt on speaker in a call I didnt even notice it was there until a couple days later Since phone cases will make a cutout of the bottom speakers its even easier to cover it with your fingers when watching a video or playing games I feel like theres never a quiet sound for media volume at least Even the lowest setting is kinda loud but thats okay I use  wireless earbuds Googles very own so Im kinda just nitpicking All in all no problem    With performance this is my first time using Google Tensor so I cant tell if the G2 is an upgrade from the original The phone is smooth and responsive but I do notice it gets really hot when playing games I hardly play games anymore so this isnt a problem and sometimes I cant even tell if the temperature is rising because of the case I use Sometimes Im not sure if its from my hands or from the phone itself Not gonna lie for a phone that has double the RAM of my previous I was expecting more processing power because sometimes when switching apps they refresh unexpectedly It mainly happens when opening the camera app camera app How taxing is it    Speaking of speed the fingerprint scanner is not as fast or smart as Id want it to be It sometimes doesnt recognize my thumb even when its laying flat on my screen If the 7 is this bad I dont want to imagine the 6 I heard some updates messed up the sensor but Im not so sure thats true If it is then subsequent updates should be able to fix it When the fingerprint reader doesnt work I switch to face unlock I think its more consistent than the fingerprint sensor but it seldom works in low light or when I take my glasses off so I find myself using the PIN I use Extend Unlock to limit the failed attempts and its a game changer I have it for when my phone is at home The fingerprint scanner is still important for authenticating important transactions though    I know people have problems with the battery but in my honest opinion its completely fine If I can end the day with 20 or more thats more than enough to rate the battery and I usually do Like seriously what are you guys doing on your phones But then again I usually charge it at night time After using it for a year there hasnt been a big dip in battery life Fast charging is fast enough Im using the cable that came with the phone and I havent gotten a wireless charger Whats the best one for Pixel 7 If anyone has one please let me know      Features  Extra dim is so handy because I honestly think this phone is too bright even at the darkest setting so its always toggled when I wake up I just wish you could schedule it like Night Light Autorotate is very inconsistent in its effectiveness even if the phone is in a 180 angle I feel like tilting to the left side works more than tilting to the right side Ive noticed when I turn it on it says facebased Is that the reason its so unreliable As I mentioned in the camera section I havent tried it but can Photo Unblur really work on older pics Thats really cool Battery Share is cool too but its hard to stabilize both phones    Versus Pixel 3  In comparison I honestly feel the colors were more colorful on the Pixel 3 Its a bummer that theres no SD card slot but Im basically used to it Besides you get Google One for 3 months after you get this phone The default storage space is enough for me anyway The fingerprint sensor Was way more convenient on the back and could be used for bringing down the notification shade Definitely the biggest loss Cool little details of the Pixel 3 like the colored power button Active Edge and the twotone design are missing on the 7 Even the box package was way more interesting with stickers and stuff      And thats my experience with the Google Pixel 7 Its a pretty long read but I wanted to cover all my bases I didnt talk about software because most of it isnt unique to the Pixel 7 The features section is more or less about software anyway Overall its a good phone that Ive enjoyed but it lost some of the cool features that made the Pixel line stand out Onto the next year","101":"Future Pixel Products.Hey Pixel

but I am undecided to choose between phonesSince most YouTube and website reviews are untrustworthy from my side I want to ask here to get some reallife experienceI eliminated Xiaomi etc mobiles except just doubtful about OnePlus 13R Even it looks very fine in same price range it doesnt make sense for it to pay costly about overall in good and support service for me comparing with Samsung S25 Google Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 16All we know tech specs are not very point for mobiles especially comparing Android vs iPhoneHere my general observation for average daily user no gaming  Samsung S25 800  Comfortable  compact design  Premium built quality feeling  High qualitylast generation processor that can help to keep or improve its performance including battery with patches by time  Samsung OneUI 7 looks very well performed and efficiency  Good camera  Longterm 7 years major software support  Easy adaptation with devices such as earbuds pc tv etc  Almost good in all After one year afraid of losing its smoothness on UI and lacking behind Android updates getting slow  Camera is not good in low light that I am not a fan of taking photos too  Battery performance looks behind iPhone 16 but is it still worth to buy for daily user  Google Pixel 9 Pro 920  Google product and its effectiveness fastest updates on its Android software at best combability  The best camera on the list  More RAM than S25 it is 16GB  Better battery than S25 Less comfortable than S25  Much behind performance for processor than S25 that if it is such a point for daily user since the phone has stock android as soon as it gets updates and fixes  Camera is better than S25 but not noticeable for a average user maybe  People complain some buggy performance experiences where it is not told yet for S25  It looks like just a Google fan with very good camera is interested in this mobile at this costly price range  iPhone 16 870  iPhone and iOS experience dont hurt in time no afraid to get buggy or slower which is the most important for me  Good camera with better performance at lowlight than S25 which is not a case for me  As Pixel it will get all updates and fixes in fastest way not get behind  Its processor A18 beats Pixels up G4 in anyway like Samsung S25s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3  Maybe the best battery performance on the list For me very uncomfortable ugly design  60 Hz screen looks like a small

sometimes one bud works sometimes none which led me to believe it was a problem with my phone But when I connected my wifes Sudio T2 buds theres no issue Works flawless Please help what is wrongI dont want to buy new earbuds if the issue is with my phone","108":"Pixel 7 no earbuds working.My jabra earbuds started acting up Left earbud audio goes in and out So I bought new earbuds from truefree Same

it seemed to be working better then What do I do now","109":"Pixel buds Pro 2 Review.Received Pixel buds pro 2 on 27th Unboxed and saw cute candy shaped earbuds and I instantly fell in love with them Okay visual stuff aside we are here for the soundSo my experiences in audio field is I would say above average  I rather list my gadgets and creations you be the judgeWorked on modding multiple headphone amps DACs etc  Opamps PCB Design for optimising audio Caps precision resistors etcMy current main desktop gearSMSL SU9 DACJDS Labs Atom headphone AMP Opamp moddedCustom amplifier and custom speakersHeadphones usedBeyerdynamic DT 990 Pro 1990 ProSennheiser HD 600  HD 560smultiple other headphones including HiFiman plannar headphones etcIEMsFiio f9 Pro multiple ChiFis etcTWS usedSony XM 4 Sennheiser MTW 4 Pixel buds Pro OG Tried many other TWS but I dont consider them as good as theseSo coming to the buds pro 2Firstly with medium tips I felt comfortable and paired with my Pixel 7 Pro pretty intuitive setup and seal check went okay Few moments later I got ear pain So took the buds out changed the tip to small and all went smoothly from thereThen checked the settings and theres an update available for the buds Updated them took approx 10 minThen went to Apple music started playing tracks Lossless and found them to be detailed but smooth treble has some smoothness to it and geared towards sssssssssss instead of shhhhhhhh xDBass I found is not as pronounced as OG buds but then you can eq them mids are slightly recessed vocals sound slightly thin but in default tuningOverall has a very balanced sound signature to it in the balanced modeCompared to the best TWS in audio quality ive used MTW 4 Pixel buds does not have the sparkle of MTW4 or the bass extension but the still sounds extremely good Over all MTW 4 sounds way open and detailed as it also has aptX HD codec but in pbp2 theres slight muddy ness to itI guess the reason is the Codec used by google The OG buds support OPUS codec which i think is superior than SBC and AAC and surprisingly even OPUS is not listed in the Pixel buds pro 2 menu  I dont want to enable it in the dev settings Noise cancellation is much much better than OG buds its on par with my Sony xm4 with its foam tips and with silicon tips Pixel buds are much superior to sony in cancelling the noise its almost on par with boseLTDR  Excellent ANC Fantastic buds very detailed sound and its drivers are more capable than what they currently got I hope google will provide some HiRes support in future update The sound felt like you playing an MP3 in ELAC speakers you know that they can sound much better but source got you drowned","110":"Google pixel 7 Bluetooth crackling.Hi Ive been experiencing this for a few months

amount of timeWhen I first got them Getting voice attention was easy The touch controls were responsive and reliable The buds would connect and ping me they were active very quickly People could hear me in phone conversations with themCompared to now Voice doesnt listen for shit The left earbud doesnt acknowledge touch controls unless I unpairrepair and even then it normally stops working again by the next day The right earbud just goes dootdoot when I try the touch control for talking to assistant requires a reboot of the phone to fix The buds are in my ears for 50 seconds before they start outputting audio and notifying me with the ping People say I sound like Im whispering quietly through a blanket Also possibly related even if the buds are not currently connected  if I try to have a phone conversation with someone with the actual phone they get zero sound from my mic  I have to turn off bluetooth and call back for them to be able to hear meIs this planned obsolescence","113":"Some earbuds work and some dont with my pixel 7 Why.My Jabra elite 3 quit working so I bought some cheap truefree T2 on Amazon And they had the same issue audio goes in and out

want to buy new earbuds if the issue is with my phone","114":"Pixel Buds Pro Weeks later.Full disclosure these are only my third pair of actual TWS in ears And my first high end pair I relegated my previous pair to a backuppossible workout only pair Jaybird Vista I got these primarily for integration into the Pixel 6 Pro and for the Transparency mode My expectations of audio quality were not incredibly high I did convert some of my other IEMs into TWS with various adapters but they were never designed for that So lets get right into itBattery life Ear buds  Amazing I havent worn them completely out yet but Ive had them in for most of my work day and they easily made it 34 hours at 50 The claims of 78h of battery life seems accurate Case  Not as stellar I basically need to charge it 23 times a week which amounts to 23 days of charge time Not terrible but not as good as my Jbird Vista And Im not entirely sure but I think there is some idle drain as well but honestly I find it hard to track that as it only shows the case charge as Im putting in the buds Id like for there to be a way to check case charge more organically or if there is someone please tell me I like to keep track of those thingsFit and feel Holy heck among the best Ive had in my ears The only in ears I have that absolutely fit better cost 3x as much I legitimately forget theyre in my ears I havent gone to the gym or done any strenuous activities with them yet but Ive been jostled around on the subway system sprinted with them in my ears and have done Theyre light fit right into the ear and just almost disappear They dont give any stuffy feelings or blocked feelingSound Good Very good At the very least beyond what I was expecting As I said I have some very expensive in ears Are these as amazing as the wired in ears I have Mostly no However theyre about as good as all the wireless Ive had Definitely better than the cheap 50 ones Easily on par with VModa Forza Metallo Wireless not TWS and on par with the Jaybird Vista each had things I preferred on them over the Pixel Buds Pro but the Pixel Buds Pro had things I preferred with them as well They arent without complaints I feel the highs can be a bit much I might want to tweak the bass a bit With the 5 band EQ coming they should respond quite well My biggest complaint is that they sounded a bit busy on some of the metal tracks I listened to Not everything was properly separating However its not something I notice all the time it has to be a very intricate track Maybe spacial audio will help with that when the software update hitsANCTransparency Mode Ive always had passive isolation in ears mostly because I was worried Id hear the ANC feedback Much like Ive done on every other ANC headphone Ive ever tried These are no exception That said I appreciate going quickly from ANC to Transparency with a touch of my earbud And the difference is stark Doubly so since transparency amplifies sound so the difference back and forth is more than noticeable End of the day ANC is perfectly fine for my mass transit commute And the switching makes it easy for me to listen to train announcements when they come overTransparency is everything I ever wanted and more And that was the primary reason I got these I use 1 earbud at work when using one it defaults to Transparency And when you take one out it automatically switches and pauses your music which is really nice I can have full conversations and it allows me to be completely aware at work with a single bud in Sometimes it is hard to hear over music but pausing the music makes it crystal clearOther features   Multipoint works flawlessly Connected to my computer and switched seamlessly between either my phone or my ChromeCast TV  Touch controls I have mixed results here I feel like the swipe is too sensitive and sometimes the touch isnt sensitive enough Sometimes when I just want to pause volume gets affected and sometimes when I swipe to do volume either it doesnt register the movement enough so the long press gets activated or just registered as a simple touch This is probably partially on me but the surface area of the buds and the gesture controls is also probably part of the issue here   Connectivity Amazing They reach further than any other wireless earbud has before and the connection is more even   Google assistant Again everything I want and more gives me time messages notifications all without looking at my phone I can answer texts as well just by holding the assistant bud down I havent tried live translate yet havent needed to but if it works as well as the rest of the google assistant features Im sure itll knock it out of the park   I do wish there was some more malleability in the settings Id like to change what taps to what how the buds react and I hope the 5 band EQ comes soon though wavlet does a great job I just like the idea of things being baked in But all in all these are solid for 200 and considering how often Google products go on sale any less is a steal imho","115":"Wireless earbuds for Pixel 7 advice.My bf has Google Pixel 7 and I want to gift him wireless earbuds for Christmas as he is always

Pixel Buds Pro 1st gen A couple of days ago I noticed there are features that have worked 100 fine over the last 2 months or so since getting the earbuds and have suddenly just stopped Conversation detection  Ive tried speaking softly loudly for prolonged periods of time But the media isnt pausing and ambient sound isnt coming through Both YouTube and Podcast Addict are the primary two apps I play media from but Spotify along with anything else I might not be remembering right now dont trigger the conversation detection This was one of my favorite features of the ear buds Ive tried toggling the setting on and off and even speaking while the setting was turned off with no success Tap to playpause  Self explanatory but it just doesnt work Ive made sure the tap to playpause is correct in the settings I havent tried answeringdeclining phone calls skippingrepeating tracks but I never used those anyways so I guess I just didnt think to test them Holding the right earbud to toggle noise cancellationambient sound passthrough does still work though as does volume updown by swiping and holding the left earbud for Google Assistant In ear detection  I take one earbud out both earbuds out and even have one in while placing the other in the case Audio just keeps playing It only stops when both have been removed and both placed in the case The weird thing about this one is the battery level will switch from showing both left and right to just one when removed from my ear but my media continues to play Has anyone experienced anything like the above issues Ive gone through and checked every single setting there are no firmware or phone updates and Ive forgotten reset and re paired the earbuds I dont know what else to do It makes me feel like there has to be some sort of user error going on since some of the features still work just fine and also because theyre only a couple of months old and were working perfectly fine just a few days ago I appreciate any helpinsightEdit  Another maybe weird thing Ive just noticed while messing with this for a while when I swipe forwardbackwards audio does get louderquiter as it should But that does change the volume level displayed on my phone Also when adjusting the volume using my phones volume rocker it doesnt change the audio level If I swipe forward on the ear buds and have them at whatever volume pressing the physical rocker on my phone shows the volume level dropping but nothing actually gets quieter The only exception is putting the volume bar all the way down does mute the audio This is frustrating lolEdit 2  After disconnectingreconnecting now swiping the earbuds to adjust volume is showing the volume slider on my phone adjusting accordingly Not sure whathow to reproduce my first

better.Im a music  loud music snob especially when I hit the gym and what Ive noticed is the sound quality from my old 5 year old Essential PH1 phone is better than my Pixel 7 via my Bluetooth true wireless earbuds I cant say what definitely but I definitely notice the difference in terms of crispness and bass levels I do know that back when the phone was released they blast about the audio chip on the Essential PH1 but Bluetooth uses Bluetooth to transmit audio it doesnt have an audio DAC Why is this and is there anyway to improve the audio quality of the pixel 7 pro","134":"Google pixel 7 pro Bluetooth earbuds issue.Hey guys I dont know where else to try and find a solution to this so Im really hoping someone out there has one So I recently got a replacement phone and my original galaxy buds pro2 earbuds that worked perfect with my old phone needed to be replaced right earbud volume was very low so I got some Tozo replacements while I waited to get some funds to buy new buds I finally got the new buds but now Im having an issue with them disconnecting and reconnecting whenever I closeswitch out of a game application My other Tozo earbuds arent doing this and I cannot seem to find any solution when I try and Google it Ive tried disabling the A2DP but that only made it worse by causing them to now disconnect and reconnect after opening and closing the appsAny help or tips or ideas would be great fully appreciated ","135":"My Pixel 8 Review it works very underwhelming kinda crappy.I upgraded from my Samsung A71 to a Pixel 8 regular just after new years The Samsung was mostly okay but had a cracked screen and occasionally glitched and the mic  voice assistant was very barely useful I figured the Pixel 8 would be a step up in at least a few areas especially since Im a heavy google userIts not Its basically just as good as that old basic A71  That said this phone is costing me only 5  month for 24 months and that includes an upgrade from 12 to 70 GB of data and from LTE to 5G So basically its costing me 0Overall verdict 6 10 if it werent too much a PITA Id return it to Koodo Canada and use my Galaxy A71 for another 612 months until something worth while came out Ill be shocked if I can get 7 years out of this but Im optimistic if current performance holds with the occasional reformat it just might Maybe try a 7 Pro Or just dont get a Google hard to sayDisclaimer Im sure there is a LOT I could be doing to set this phone up better and make better use of features I did a fairly clean install only transferring contacts  messages  offline music from my old phone but manually installed all apps Gaccounts settings WhatsApp backup etc I super welcome feedback that tells me Im doing it wrong and how I can make this work better for meREVIEW BY CATEGORYIm a light user Tons of google suite messaging apps calendar drive mail whatsapp constantly all day socials and various 3rd party apps for devices like Starlink Galaxy Buds etc Basically nothing intensive Lots of voice text voice memos and using Assistant to set reminders call places look up info etcBattery This was good at first On basic use I almost got through THREE days It was around 5 at 4 or 5pm on work day 3 Text and browsing almost exclusively Then on a travel day 1 hr of 5G in the car 30min Zoom w Video  30min soundcloud music via car bluetooth plus 15 hrs of offline music to bluetooth earbuds and I was down to 50 wtf So 2 hrs of Zoom or 45 hrs of music streaming and this thing is dead Thats no bueno 5 10Screen  size I do like the size shift from my gigantic A71 It fits in my pockets all of them Its a little thicker which is  whatever its just too small to watch a show on but frankly thats probably a good thing Yes it seems clearer  crisper and probably brighter but does that actually improve my use Not so far 810Voice assistant I was really expecting Google assistant on a google phone to be great or at least good It is mediocre Asking it to textmessage something is glitchy and if its more than a short sentence then forget about it Asking is to call a business is pretty useless Painfully accurate annunciation is required Honestly the mic  Google assistant on my Bose smart speaker 5 yrs old is way way way better and understand normal speech from across the room blargh 2 10Features Im sure I have LOTS to discover and I generally appreciate them Haptic feedback always on display customized do not disturb  sleep schedule etc etc etc I dont  wont use most of this but it seems solid and versatile Lift and tap to unlock is great double tap on the back is neat future 9 10Connectivity this seems better than my samsung Despite warnings about the modem I am generally connected more often and with a stronger signal both WiFi  cell  data i live rurally in the mountains so this is big 1010Camera very disappointed Not intuitive not excellent photos Just as mediocre as my Samsung unless I really put in effort to get the right setting which I have to do manually THere isnt even an autoflash based on lowlight that I can turn on Night mode seems decent I think And macro is pretty solid Photos are stunning done right and a PITA to get right 7  10 hardware 3  10 softwarePerformance Bootup  reboot is OK but still kinda slow for what it has to load and how much RAM  CPU power is in there As much as my laptop but takes quite a lot longer to load Once on its pretty fast to load and navigate but already 23 weeks in itll lag here or there in random places I never have more than a dozen apps open or a dozen chrome tabs so thats a big red flag 7  10","136":"Best cases Pixel 7 and Pixel Buds Pro.Hi guys Im looking for some good cases for both my phone and earbuds The ones i have now are pretty good and strong but i

review for Google Pixel 8 Pro.I just want to leave a usage review since Ive daily driven my Pixel 8 Pro for more than 6 months now coming from a Samsung S20 FE I switched to Pixel mainly because of the free smartwatch that it came with when preordered but I really preferred to go the Samsung route more below so I switched with a big bias But I think the review is as fair as I can be as a regular notsophonetechy userx200BPro  1 Camera Im not a big picture taker but I certainly noticed the big difference from my old phone to this  2 I do like the UI compared to Samsung and from factory the phone came with less bloatware imo compared to my S20 back then Though the only thing I would love to change with the UI is the buttons I miss how I can configure those with Samsung  3 Overall the hardware performs pretty good I dont game on my phone so I dont really feel the phone struggle with its workloads  4 The phone itself has a really nice feel and one of the biggest reason why I didnt go towards the S2324 is the size If I wanted the top phone in that model the Ultras have the pen and its essentially a Samsung tab phone from years ago I feel like 8 Pro is a decent size  5 The screen size is pretty good I can watch videos on it comfortably  6 The fact that it is made by Google means no Bixby which is like point 2 awesome because even back in Samsung I used Google assistant anyway  7 With an exception to point 2 I like how customizable it is like I said I dont do a lot of things on my phone so I am easy to please in this regardx200BCons Unfortunately this outweighs the Pros for me  1 Randomly incoming phone calls get dropped before it even reaches me I wear the watch most of the time so I should at least know if someone calls me but even then I only get notified after I missed the call no ring whatsoever Ive checked my DnD which is never on and it also happens to incoming calls from my saved contact list and other unknown numbers both from my region and outside Checked with support and my provider and both basically pointed fingers at each other only way to truly test this is to daily drive my old phone for a while I havent but Ive never experienced this at all in my old phones from the same provider on the same account  2 Dark mode on the Google search widget randomly gets disabled I have dark mode always on but sometimes when I search something on the widget when it loads its on light mode And the only way to revert this is to go on the settings and disable dark mode and reenable it Interestingly this issue started to happen recently so Im guessing from an OS upgrade  3 Again with the Google search widget randomly whenever I search something after pressing enter it says no network connection but after I click Try again it works Happens both on WiFi and cell data I have a different browser that also have a widget I want to try it but Google as a search engine is still a beast so Im debating whether I should do it or not  4 Randomly the weather widget just stops working Its still there but no weather info cant refresh it either  5 Another random issue theres times when I hit the home button from somewhere doesnt matter if it is a browser social media app YouTube or whatever the keyboard pops up But I have nothing to type on because its the homepage not sure why the software brings it up randomly  6 This is a small issue for me I hate Google Photos and the Google Gallery app is not as good as Samsungs gallery app imo There are features on Samsung that I love for example if I edit a photo on Samsung it asks if I want to save a copy or save to overwrite the original but with Pixel it just saves copy I do quick and simple edits for work so its annoying that I need to delete the original because I never need it though I understand its by design since its a good idea to have the original but at least give the option  7 Another small issue the vibrate isnt strong enough There are times when I need the phone to be nearsilent but still know when I have notifications hence vibrate but even if its in my back pocket sometimes I still miss it This is now a small issue for me because I usually wear the watch so at least my wrist would feel something when I get notifications  8 Sometimes the phone freezes for several moments I have to click the lock button or spam the home button and it miraculously works after  9 Just recently probably caused by another update when I am connected to my earbuds not Google or car through Android Auto the phone randomly goes on call but theres no call window on the phone or the car screen I know I am on call because the earbud goes on hearthrough even though it is set on ANC which typically happens when I am on call Also the car dashboard says In a call when I am even though the Android Auto screen doesnt  10 Initial setup with Android Auto when I first got the phone was a NIGHTMARE I remember my old Samsung and it was literally plug and play then configure afterwards But for this I had to do some wonky workaround I found online to get it to workEdit 11 Sometimes my home WiFi doesnt automatically connect its not a broadcasted SSID so I have to manually add it There was a time when I had to tinker with the settings to get it to work Something I never had to do with my old phoneTLDR Hardware wise the feel of the phone is good camera is exceptional for my use and its not struggling for me But SOOOO MANY bugs on the software that doesnt get fixed right away or just havent been fixedI would love to get another Pixel because Samsung is more expensive and the Ultra is too large for my taste top of the line have better freebies D but if by the time I switch phone Im still having these issues Ill definitely go back to Samsung","138":"How has the Pixel Watch Been for

phone must work on ATT in the US and my dads phone must have NFCSecond I am open to all ideasThird I dont really know what Im doing when it comes to choosing phones I bought a Motorola in 2022 that I thought was great Had a pretty good camera and a great battery Turns out the accessibility options were poor and I cant use the phone because its too hard to see It also had this weird issue where sometimes the screen would never wake up with an incoming call So I use it as an audiobook player and I got myself an S21 FE which I love and is great though the camera is not as good as that Motorola my biggest issue with it is the battery is horrible and the high refresh rate isnt as nice looking as that Motorola eitherSo my parents need new phones They currently have a pair of 7 year old LG phones that have overheated from the beginning but otherwise werent too bad for their time and price This was my moms only smartphone My dad has past pre2019 experience with iPhones too However hes been using this Android phone and a couple Android tablets for 45 yearsMy parents keep putting of getting new phones despite needing them desperately if it was solely up to me I would have gotten them A series like A52 53 54 a long time agoMy mom uses her phone for calling and texing streaming music and videos simple games like solitare and apps for like grocery and coupons Shed probably take photos too but she cant see well so theyre usually bluryMy dad needs NFC for his continuous glucose monitor He is always using a cheap stylus on his tablet and he uses voice input to send text messages call people and look up phone numbers He uses the camera as a magnifier This is something I do also and that finicky Motorola was good for this but my S21FE doesnt do the job as wellHe takes a lot of cat pictures and videos I am truly concerned he could fill up a phone and hes against using cloud services Other concerns my dad has broken or lost every iPhone hes ever hadeven with OtterBoxes He left the LG at the grocery store once in 3 years thankfully it was still there when he went right back 10 minutes laterI am also concerned if he ends up with a phone like the s22 Ultra hes either going to lose the sPen  or hes just not going to use it because its not full sized and hes going to use a 1 oneYou might wonder why I have such wide options for phones To me as an uninformed person the A54 and Pixel 8 look very similar in terms of features I know the Pixel has twice as many updates but is it worth twice the price Plus it has expandable SD slotThe s22 Ultra is supposed to haves as many years of updates as the A54 It is older so there is less benefits to the updates but the specs seem to blow the Pixel 8 out of the water and it has 256GB12GB for 800 USD to Pixels 128GB6GB for 700 USD earbuds includedIs the Pixel a better choice over the A54 for 330 USD Do the 7 years of updates make it worth twice as muchIs better to get a better older phone with the s22 UltraShould we be considering other phones Other brandsI dont want to lose out on accessibility features liked very large text or magnification or features like Samsung routines and Good Lock but

if I close the Audible app closing the app fully and relaunch it the echoing sound will resolve and sound as expected for the listening session Similarly if I switch to playing music from Spotify or similar the sound goes back to normal when I switch back to Audible making me think this is a software issue Have read about others toggling ACC in the settings with the same resolution of the

Very happy with the phone nice and snappy amazing pictures but during phone calls around 810 mark the sound sounds distortedcrackling This happens every time around the 810 minute mark If you hang up and call back theres no crackling sound again until the 810m mark This happens in handsfree speaker mode earphone mode even if I hook up my Bluetooth earbuds theres a distorted crackling sound Weirdly enough around the 1620 min mark the sound fixes itself again enabling clear sounding does slightly improve it but it also lowers your volume and its not a very good option I tried two Dutch simcards which are Vodafone and KPN but both have this issue So I figured the phone is defective so I returned it to the retail and they gave me a brand new Pixel 7 On the second pixel 7 I did a clean install without installing any apps All I did is update the phone to the latest build My second pixel 7 has the exact same issue around the 8 or 10 min mark sound is distorted  crackling Cellular receive is

different.Ive had various dumbphones a few palm phones etc then Nexus 1 in 2009 Note 1 in 2011 LG G2 in 2013 Pixel XL 1 in 2016 and Pixel 3 XL as of yesterday just for a little history  And heres some off the top of the head observationsAs I have been setting up my new phone I cant think of anything that is just that much better than the old Pixel 1 XL  There are improvements of course  More screen space I imagine the camera is better although I dont take many pictures with phones  Responsiveness is the same  3 feels heavier  3 boots a lot faster thats nice but I dont reboot the phone much  1 had a single speaker 3 has two speakers but one of them is MUCH quieter than the other whats worse a clock thats 5 minutes fast or stopped and neither sound very good  Wireless charging is convenient always liked that with my Nexus 7 2013 although the cheapie I got off Amazon shows charging slowly so well see how that goes  Itll be primarily for overnight charging so itll probably be fineRealistically having the Pixel 1 XL for two years it was time to replace it  Eventually the battery is going to wear to a point where its bugging me etc but otherwise its not that big a bump for me  This isnt a dig on the 3 except the speakers I think its just a statement that there have just been subtle improvements nothing major  And thats okay smartphones have mostly been doing polish for a few years  Im sure well see another major feature or new thing and theyll go through more cycles of this as they evolve but overall  I needed it but its not excitingTransfering my Wear watch between the phones was kind of annoying I really wish theyd just let you do this especially now that Wear 20 is pretty independent of the phone anyway  But after doing the handful of adb commands a few times it finally worked  Transferring the fitbit wasnt too badI unlocked the bootloader and installed Magisk first thing and then let Android transfer all of my apps which seemed to do a pretty good job although Im always surprised that some apps but not their settings transfer like Nova Launcher  It was installed but not my setup  But then after I pushed my Pixel 1 files up to the new phone I went through Titanium Backup and restored anything missing everything missing was NOT in the play store anymore so thats a good sign that most apps support the backup mechanism including data so phone is pretty much exactly like the old one wasHavent tried the USB C Pixel Buds yet I might check them out for giggles later but Ive been using a few bluetooth earbuds and earphones for a few years now so Im happy with how all of that worksIm waiting out the tempered glass fiasco that always happens with a new phone until someone figures out how to properly do it  Hopefully I dont scratch the screen while I wait  It honestly only takes a hand with some silica which is in pretty much every dirt etc in the pocket then the phone in the pocket and the phone rubbing it etc  Using the same brand of case Ive used for years SpigenAnd I suppose I have to mention the notch  I only notice it when the screen is bright white or such  In every other normal use I dont even notice it at all  Ive always considered a notch to be two extra screens for notifications like the LG V20 did one screen for extra space  That was just as an observer  Now as a user I feel the same  I dont even notice itSo TLDR  Speakers seem bad maybe Google can tune them a bit better in software Otherwise feels like a very minor upgrade from a Pixel 1 XL","145":"Pixel 8 Pro Or wait for next year.Hi all I am an iPhone 11 user looking to switch to a newer phone  Years ago I got a Pixel 4 and have been using it with the iPhone 11 since though less on the Pixel since its back is peeling off and I dont want it to explode in my face I really enjoy the clean stock Android look and integration with all of Googles services I also liked the photos taken on the 4 they have a super crisp look and are bright at night  Now that my 11 is slowly dying I was going to replace it next year with the 16 series since I already got an apple watch 7 ipad pro and airpods But since the 8 pro dropped with the free watch Ive been thinking Its 100 canadian cheaper than the 15 pro at 1349 plus the free pixel watch 2 and with the tradein added closer to 1154 after tradein This tempts me to go back to the Pixel phones I havent been following the Pixels since 5 and really heard about it when 8 launched It looks like a big improvement and is comparable to the new iphones except the A series chips x200BSo now I dont know if I should consider switching now before the oct 16 deadline or wait a year for potentially the iphone 16 and pixel 9 series since I heard rumors saying they might have smaller pro models but I dont know if they will offer the same free watchearbuds promotion I am in no rush to switch considering my current phone is working fine so I am just considering my options  Thanks in advance","146":"Pixel Bud Pro as a gift.Hi everyonemy wifes birthday is coming closer and she mentioned some weeks ago that she thinks about switching to wireless earbuds Currently she uses an old USB C iem that came in the

small ears and experience with the Pixel Buds Pro Im afraid the buds themselves dont fit into the outer part of the ear Sorry there is probably a better word for this I just dont know how do you in

New Pixel 7.Having gotten bored of my previous phone a Samsung Galaxy F62 I began my quest to daydream about my future phone I fixated my eyes on a rather old device iPhone 14Pro Willing to spend a major chunk of my income on a new phone it would be an understatement to say that my family did not share my excitement But my older brother did support me and we went to look for a new phone I went to a local phone shop not so local a major brand and asked if they had a Pixel phone The shopper started giving me lessons on Android in a rather aggressive manner and he seemed to take offense at my crime of asking for a Pixel phone He wanted me to be punished for this crime with a Vivo phone It was sleek and sexy but I did not want a Vivo or any other Chinese phone I had made up my mind I would buy one of the three  Google Samsung or iPhone Funny how we dont use Apple for Apple phones Then I began my hunt to test a few phones fell in love with the new iPhone 15 base variant loved the back glasss texture better than the pro I quickly realized that it was unwise to spend this big amount of money on a phone So I tried the phone I had thought of buying a Samsung Galaxy S23 I love that phone I think it is made for me but it is much overpriced Meanwhile during the phone hunt I had my eyes on the Green Pixel After thinking a lot managing the finances I took the plunge and ordered a new phone for me  A green Pixel 7 One month later I still havent fallen in love with the phone Its a great phone dont get me wrong Its just that I became comfortable with my previous Samsung way faster Google should allow as much if not less customization as Samsung I dont like to use a case or a screen guard on my phones but knowing it is an expensive phone I am forced to use a case and guard I did not buy into the Pixel camera hype and please believe me I did not buy the Pixel for its camera The camera is mostly nice but it makes you feel and realize that it is not the hardware thats working it is the software and that has taken away some of the satisfaction I was hoping to get from my Pixel I havent faced any problems with the phone some bugs here and there But the phone does not offer anything extra for me it is good enough The only things I hate on my phone are its fingerprint sensor and a lack of a headphone jack I cannot stress this enough I miss my fricking wired earphones and I refuse to buy Bluetooth ear pods I like my existing earphones but theyre lying lifelessly in my cupboard The fingerprint sensor is very slow and very inaccurate I hate it and wish that future phones have Apples Face ID or a sidemounted fingerprint sensor or a fucking fast sensor I was not expecting Pixels to have good video recording capability but it has and I am more than satisfied with the videos coming out straight from the native app It is very good Pixel images are hit or miss for me I love the colors but quality takes a hit sometimes it is not as consistent as an iPhone To sum up if my Pixel had a headphone jack I think I would have been the most the happiest soul in the world An adapter will not give the same level of satisfaction One thing I love about the Pixel is its design I love flaunting it Overall it is a good phone but this phone is not for everyone A better option for folks would be a cheaper phone or a little more expensive one OnePlus 11 I would even recommend the S22 but it has a rubbish battery CheersI live in India S22 was cheaper than the Pixel 7 one plus 11 was around 7k Rupees expensive than the P7 at the time of purchase","149":"Pixel 6a or something else after 7 years of hypersleep.Im upgrading from a Motorola MOTO G 3rd gen bought at the end of 2015 I dont play games Just calls messaging social media now

the stock android It seems to be nice and functional but Im a bit worried about battery as well as other specs RAM screen becoming obsolete too soon I dont need my phone to be a Google Pixel so Im open to any other brand if I can get a better value device for the same or less money So I wouldnt mind choosing another model if there is something with more value overall According to some people you get more value better specs with Chinese models these days Keeping in mind that Im willing to spend 200300  or even 350 if I get a Pixel 6a and that I hope to get a lasting phone what do you think","150":"My thoughts on the Z Flip 5 coming from S22U Pixel 7 iPhone XR.Coming from an S22 Ultra Snapdragon Ive had the Z Flip 5 for a few days and here are my thoughts in no particular order Screen The main pro is that the flipping aspect is awesome Novel but with a purpose and the footprint in my pocket is noticeably better obviously The main con for me is that the screen is borderline unusable if you have polarized glasses severe rainbow effect and that is not the case with the S22 Ultra The plastic feeling vs tempered glass is also a negative but it seems better than I had expected Fingerprint sensors They both have pretty good sensors but I do find that the Z Flip 5s misses more when my hands are sweaty if Im out on a bike ride for example Speakers I think both speakers are average to above average and I do think the Z Flip 5s are pretty decent Headphone sound quality Seems very good on both devices Shure earphones and it can power HD600s Charging speeds The S22U is much better in this regard even topping up from 80 to 100 it seems to pull more watts than the ZF5 The ZF5 will top out at like 12W on a 90W PD charger where my S22U will charge at a much higher rate Cameras Obviously the S22U has way more versatility with the 3x and 10x and the lack of telephoto on the ZF5 might be the thing I miss the most For now Ill deal with it and Im taking fewer pictures unless I carry a second phone or my real camera Performance Seems to be about the same between either phone I did get a the phone is warm toast notification when I was setting it up but I had it out and about today in 85F weather and there were no issues The ZF5 also force restarted itself when I tried using Google Assistant on the cover screen then opened it up and it rebooted Ill keep an eye on that Battery life S22U does have an edge but thats to be expected even being 18 months old at this point I think the ZF5s battery life is acceptable and I typically am around chargers much of the day My typical use has gotten me about 1518 hours with 354 hours SOT so I can live with thatOverall this little phone is pretty awesome The cover screen with the Good Lock apps module makes this thing pretty usable without even opening it up I will admit that laying out 7mo for Samsungs care program is worth it for my peace of mind I dont really have a ton of confidence in this phone lasting more than a year or so due to the moving parts but as with a lot of people I will be planning on trading it in next summer if the trade in deals are still amazing","151":"Pixel buds pro or Galaxy buds pro 2.I have a Pixel 7 and had some pixel buds aseries earphones They were good enough for me personally but now after 8 months the left bud is noticeably quieter than the right I want to upgrade to a better pair and the galaxy buds also caught my eye I really liked the pixel buds The fit was really good the sound was good and they were overall just a really nice pair of earbuds But I hear the galaxy buds are meant to be good also Each have pros and cons So I ask you which would you go for and why Would I lose any compatibility switching from my phones brand Google to Samsung","152":"This is what to expect after switching from Galaxy S22 to Pixel 7.Samsung CalendarIf youve been saving your calendar events to a Samsung account instead of Gmail there is no easy way to transfer the data to Google Calendar at least not that I know of I installed an app called Calendar Import  Export ics on the Galaxy and proceeded to backup Samsung Calendars 500 entries I placed the backup file on Google Drive and opened it on Pixel The Google Calendar on Pixel was only able to import 200 entries Its as if there is a hardcoded limit set to 200 tried multiple timesIn the end I had to do everything manually open a calendar event on Galaxy tap edit change the sync account to Gmail Do it for every calendar entry tap sync on Galaxy tap sync on PixelBackup your appsMake sure to manually backup the data in your important apps especially messenger apps on the Galaxy because not everything will be automatically transferred during the Pixel setup Some apps do automatically backup their data but only once a week so a manual backup immediately before a transfer is necessaryDisplay Refresh90Hz refresh rate is good enough Coming from 120Hz I didnt feel a noticeable difference Im sure if you place them sidebyside itll be visible but 90 is far better than 60Screen QualityPixel has a better screen Its sharper Im nearsighted so whenever I dont wear glasses in bed the display is really close to my face This is why every ppi counts I havent noticed a worse picture quality Again if we place them sidebyside we might notice something but its a great screenGalaxy has a higher maximum brightness Probably only useful outdoors under the sunBrightness controlGalaxy has a better screen brightness management Pixels automatic brightness always makes it too dim literally seconds after I manually swipe the bar higher No matter how many times I manually move the slider it doesnt seem to learn Ill give it a week and switch the brightness to manual control Gesture controlGalaxy wins I had to use an ADB command on a laptop to disable Pixels gesture navigation and replace it with the FNG app because for some reason Google thinks there are no apps with hamburger menus so they made their back gesture in a way that it occupies the entire left edge from top to bottom leaving no room at the top for the user to swipe right to open a drawer in an app You literally cant open app drawers The workaround is to tap and hold the edge until a drawer popsout and only then swipe But why make the experience worse for the user if a better option is available Google Samsung with its inhouse custom apps forgot what they are called handles it far better App launcherPixel launcher is a joke It lacks basic customization features too many to list and occupies a huge chunk of the main homepage with an at a glance useless crapware and an impossibletomove search bar I installed Microsoft Launcher and customized it to the core Hey at least we have an option to install launchers NotificationsFirst of all Samsungs email app is better than the Gmail app When an email arrives Samsung lets you mark it read right in the notification popup Gmail only lets you archivedelete Its a little annoyance that wastes time unnecessarilySecond Gmail wont sync and display every email unless I manually sync the inbox I removed all the background restrictions on Gmail and hopefully itll work So far it does seem to have fixed the problem Why on Earth does Gmail come with restricted background activities by defaultNotification panel looks better on Galaxy The notification entries on Pixel feel bulky and a waste of space Pull down quick settingsPixel only shows 4 entries vs the 6 on Galaxy This is a big difference The whole purpose of this thing is to place the most commonly used activities a single tap away Not only does Pixel waste space by using unnecessarily huge buttons but it requires you to make another swipe to see a total of 8 entries Then another right swipe to see the rest Its just poorly designedBluetooth earphonesIm using Galaxy Buds No connection or quality issues on Pixel There is a dead spot in my house so I wanted to compare how the two phones handle it when I leave the phone away and enter the dead spot With Galaxy the sound begins to break up a word will be dropped here and there and after half a minute of struggling it may or may not disconnect from the phone On Pixel it actually continues to play without dropped words but then suddenly disconnects much sooner than on Galaxy Not sure if this is phonerelated or something else Photo backupsI used OneDrive on Galaxy It seems better than Google Photos because it actually preserves the timestamps of your photos and provides a dedicated folder with photos Last time I used Google Takeout to download the photo database last year it fucked up every single photo I had to spend several weekends and use software to edit the photos to insert the timestamps on the file names For example IMG20221205jpg means its taken on December 5 2022 When you place it in a folder Windows Explorer should properly sort it under December 5 But the photos exported from Google Photos no longer had this timestamps so they were all showing the date when they were exported from Google servers OneDrive does properly save timestamps and it actually makes the photos accessible as a folder in the OneDrive app on your desktop You can take a photo on the phone and open the OneDrive folder on the desktop and your photo will be there In comparison there is no Google Photo folder in Google Drive you have to use their website to access the photos Downloading multiple photos from Google Photos requires you to go through annoying menu entries download one big zip file then unzip it Now compare this to a simple draganddrop with OneDrive We have a winnerLumia vibesLet me tell you an old story The best feeling phone Ive ever held in my hand was the Microsoft Lumia 640 It was a squareish phone that felt right at a time when every other manufacturer was busy ruining their phones with curvy edges and shit that nobody asked for Fk that shit Pixel 7 feels like Lumia 640 It feels squareish and kind of on the heavy side for its display size but it feels balanced and premium heavy not let me put it down because my wrist is hurting heavyPerformancePixel gets noticeably hotter The games I play are not too resources intensive so I personally dont care about having the best CPUEcosystemGoogle wins here I even decided to switch from Galaxy Watch 4 to Fitbit Inspire 3 They are two entirely different products Galaxy Watch is a watch with full functionality while Fitbit is a fitness tracker with more limited functions And yet Fitbit feels better and more useful after two days of using it Its better simply because its lighter smaller and lasts longer Ill take those over fancy watch keyboards and app stores that I know Im never going to use  I spent the entire day with it on my wrist and totally forgot about it Galaxy Watch on the other hand is always there and waiting to be adjusted twisted tightened or loosened No maintenance necessary with Fitbit Oh and its battery lasts much longerScreen protectorI wasnt able to find a tempered glass screen protector for Galaxy S22 that works with the fingerprint reader Im aware there is a setting to increase sensitivity but it still missed the taps 50 of the time On Pixel 7 on the other hand the very first tampered glass that I came across to a cheap crap form eBay has worked wonderfully Is it because they use different finger sensing technologiesTradeinIm paying practically nothing by trading the S22 for Pixel 7 and Fitbit Hopefully Google will honor the trade in terms","153":"How does multiple audio sources work on pixel 7.On samsung phone ecosystem you down load an app sound assistant and it lets the phone play multiple audio sources at once like games music audio book and Streaming social media can all output into earphones Without that app behavior of the phones tends to be one audio source plays at a timeHows it work on pixels That multisource audio is a big deal to me Its the difference between being gimpy phonelike and computerlike as far as audio outputThanks","154":"Pixel 7 Pro review after one week.So before the pitchforks come out here me outx200BThis is for whoevers thinking about trying the Pixel 77 Pro I hope people can be open minded and not be in a walled garden for any one company Its sometimes best to know whats out there to make an informed decision That being saidx200BThis review obviously isnt comprehensive nor is it complete Its simply my thoughts on the Pixel 7 Pro having used it for a week and perhaps thatd be more apt than review Some caveats to add Its a brand new phone Everything in theory is working at its absolute best Im comparing it against the S22u and I am well aware these phones are in two different categories in terms of pricing and how they are viewed in terms of their respective hierarchiesx200BAlso to note Ive owned many of the modern flagships in the past few years ranging from the 6 Pro S21U 13 Pro Max Note 20 Ultra 12 Pro Max Pixel 5 etc etcx200BMy initial thoughts I cant appreciate enough how light it feels in the hand It has a nice uniformity to it and its not as awkward to hold as the S22U nor as girthy as the Pro Max series This doubles when you consider its offering relatively the same height and basically design metrics as those two You also wouldnt be able to tell the difference between the 6 Pro and 7 Pro if you flipped them on their fronts Design is great When I first saw the renders I have to be honest and say I wasnt too much of a fan of either the 7 or how the 6 looked The 45 design was OK I do miss the twotoned days of the older Pixels though My favorite However its been growing on me Especially after seeing it in person Ya know for the 5 seconds before I put a case and lens protector on it Ill make a quick note and suggest that you do look into getting a case since they say the back camera bar is far more prone to scratches than its predecessor Fantastic display Id certainly say its up there with the S22U  absolutely gorgeous and crisp on QHD It definitely gets a lot brighter than its predecessors which is saying a lot because a problem I personally had with the Pixel line up was that it didnt offer nearly good enough brightness as the competitors It wasnt horrible but it wasnt great either I feel the 7 puts it in line with where modern smartphones should be and then some Almost forgot to mention this but the haptic feedback isnt bad at all iPhones rendition is superior but I cant complain hereQuality is clear and nice I should note that Ive seen a complaint on forums stating how users are experiencing yellowishtint and washed out colors on their 77 Pros I havent experienced this or maybe my eyes arent that great at discerning it YMMV Speakers arent bad Its loud and if Im not mistaken perhaps louder than the S22U but certainly not as full sounding I dont have an issue with it and I typically use my earphones anyways But good speaker and sound quality nonetheless I havent tuned it nor care to But Im sure thats an option if you should choose Battery isnt bad When I bought the 6 Pro I had bought it used and the battery drain was noticeable I dont know how this will fair in the next month or so but for now it gets me through a day comfortably with moderate usage Youtube social media Google maps no gaming I got about 5 hrs of screen on time from 100to20 with the above usage If my math is correct that would make it 6 if I ran it to zero QHD 60 brightness  which is in line with what I was getting on my used S22U I will admit I havent used the camera extensively although Im very much familiar with both the Pixel and Samsungs methods of photography This doesnt matter all that much because the 7 Pro largely borrows from the 6 Pro in a lot of ways with maybe a few iterative updatesupgrades This extends to the selife camera which looks virtually no different then how it did on the 6 Pro The viewfinder looks really grainy in low light and I know most phones do but its REALLY noticeable on the 67 Pro and decent during the daytime The pictures are meh at best The sharpness and quality that Pixels were known for in their older models is not here And in all honestly its almost as if it has regressed  in my OPINION I still say S22U is EASILY the standout phone when it comes to selfies holding that title since the S21U of both the Pixel AND Pro Max series The selfies look low quality At least if youre comparing it to other modern flagships Not as sharpx200B Front cameras are great as always Again I havent had a chance to really explore with portrait shots and other environment snaps but for the pictures I have taken theyve come out pretty good For the record Im not one of those reviewers like the Tech channels that are taking pictures and then blowing them up to see every nuanced hair follicle to discern whether or not one takes better quality pictures over the other I very much take most pictures at face value And youd be hard pressed to find differences in most flagship phones unless were talking each respective companies computational takes on different exposures and environments In which case if you know your phones its really no different here But I will admit after having taking many many pictures with different phones over the few years Id say the older Pixels think 23 had the lead in this category say for the botched portrait shots some photos had with the single lens shooter then iPhone was a close second and easily the most consistent Now S22U takes this category I feel its the most well rounded in terms of stills and its camera suite However as the reviewers put it the Pixel does capture more details in most instances FWIW 95 of viewing my photos on my phone so its not a big deal to mex200B Video Almost forgot to mention this The video on this thing is great Id say the camera quality is sharper than the S22Us video The degree of view from the primary camera seems slightly larger too in comparison although I may be imagining this Im gonna have to look at the specs to verify Aside from that its great Havent done much shooting with video yet but if the 6 Pro is anything to go by its in the conversation with phones outputting the best video quality x200B Performance is great Ive yet to come across a stutter or lag but time will tell Apps are snappy upon opening and closing and the navigating the UI is buttery smooth This has carried on from the Pixel 6 Pro In my experience its more smoother than the S22U but do note its a matter of opinion and experience When I had the 6 Pro beside my S22U the S22U lag was noticeable However it became a nonissue during my usage and Id say the S22 is pretty damn snappy in its own right I know many people want to know about the fingerprint reader and I gotta say its been damn impressive Aside from maybe two times where it didnt work and of the two times I had to tap to wake up and then push again I have no complaints Its super fast and on par with the S22U at the time of writing this The face unlock however is noticeably not as quick as the S22U or the iPhone S22U being the fastest and the iPhone being the best and most consistentx200B Features If youre familiar with the features of the 6 Pro then the features here should come as no surprise Theyre awesome Magic eraser works fantastically but I will say Samsungs version is also fantastic Call screening is great for those that get stupid robo calls or scammer calls often Hold For Me is a delight to have A few calls I had during this week were made that much easier due to this featurex200BIf I had to nitpick about anything its that Samsungs keyboards learning algorithms worked better for me than GBoard  specifically with adding to the dictionary or learning my usage patterns Samsungs keyboard would pick it up and suggest words Id often use within a few sessions where as with Google Ive had it add and then forget words I use often or outright not suggest it to me at all And its learning algorithm to suggest words takes longer  in my experience  than Samsungs HOWEVER again  in my experience  GBoard is far more accurate at determining which keys I hit than Samsungs keyboardx200BTakeaways for comparison sake My OPNIONx200B S22U has the better design minimalist look less intrusive camera set up less scratch prone Pixel more ergonomically friendlier in the hand and lighter S22U destroys the selfie camera on the 7 Pro S22U takes better portraits is better for zoom and offersmore flexibility with its camera options the 7 Pro is more crispersharper  and in most cases  truer to life S22U does a better job at multitasking Pixels UI feels more snappier S22Us speakers more fuller sounding Pixels more louder  Both phones have fantastic displays but the S22U gets brighter both get plenty bright though Face unlock is faster on the S22U Fingerprint unlock is about the same in terms of accuracy Battery life about the same Brand new Pixel 7 Pro vs used S22U Features offered and how you like them is entirely dependent on your use case Keyboard more accurate on Gboard but better learning algorithmssuggestions on Samsung at time of writingx200BIf you have any questions let me know Ill try to answer them as best I can","155":"Is there a market for us Pixel and the state of mobile phones.I love tech I love looking at the clever and useful and beautiful and innovative new ways clever people have made me want to throw my disposable income at them Back in 2008 after a period of being skeptical of the lack of haptic feedback in a touch screen I was convinced enough from trying an iPhone out that I imported jailbroke and queued my way up to getting them for myself Then the competition choice and fullfeaturedness of Android lured me away Circa 2014 just 7 years since the iPhone changed the world I had in my pocket a tiny waterproof multimedia computing device with an incredibly capable camera attached Email youtube internet ebooks music podcasts portable storage gaming photo and video editing you name it Full featured hardware I could plug external microSD storage into it headphone jack let me plug my earphones into it and used the earphone wire as an antenna for FM radio For the next couple of years wed only get improvements USB OTG was great It was a heady feeling I looked forward to new releases  This was the future that was promisedAll that is by way of background so that you know where Im coming from when I say I have had it up to here with the sorry and pathetic state of the modern mobile phone marketWhen an upgrade is not an upgrade What pushed me over the edge was my upgrade from the Xperia XZ1 Compact to the Pixel 3 which I bought because Google put took US300 off its retail price I use the word upgrade loosely The Pixels battery life is significantly worse The fingerprint sensor is worse The size and position of the phone and the controls which in the XZ1C allowed for onehanded operation from the moment I touched it to the moment I put it down is worse on the Pixel There is no headphone jack my IEMs dont work unless I use the dongle and then I have to carry around this extra freaking dongle around No more hardware notification LED that I can customise to different colours for different notifications No microSD slot which I used rather extensively on the XZ1C About the only practically useful improvement to me was the camera and I suppose actually having Android 10 and a couple more years of software updates The rest  wireless charging better speakers bigger screen  theyre nice to have but dont really make a huge impact on my needs In short in all practical respects the Pixel 3 is actually a major downgrade from the XZ1C Whats the alternative If there were something on the market for me to buy Id have considered it But it is 2019 and if you want a compact long lasting yet fully featured phone with a headphone jack micro SD card slot waterproofing easy to use onehand accessible side fingerprint sensor that is reasonably priced your best bet is the XZ1C a phone released in 2017 Your second best bet is the walletbursting S10e at US749 The Pixel 3 was a compromise purchase which only made it into consideration because of its discounted price I dont know of any other alternatives Worst of all all signs point to regression See if I thought there was something better coming soon or if signs pointed to progress I would accept the Pixel 3 as a temporary dip until something better comes along Instead the trends are bad  Headphone jack baleeted I have a nice pair of wired IEMs that I use Nope the manufacturer and trends say youve gotta use this doodad the marketing folks call a true wireless BT earphone which is the best thing ever Its not I hear of jabras and sony 1000XM3s where one bud doesnt connect right audio cuts out distorts is too soft  too loud what have you Lets be fair and lets be real youre not listening to audiophile grade music on the subway or grunting your way through a workout but it would be nice to be able to use some of the nice stuff I already have lying around instead of being forced to buy overpriced new shit Side mounted fingerprint sensor nobody seems to do this anymore Theyre all back mounted on massive slabs Its awkward to use You USAians dont know what youre missing but the Sony compact phones side sensors were awesome to use Meanwhile the Pixel 4 doesnt even have a fingerprint sensor  Micro SD cards gone Why would you ever want to plug external storage in I imagine manufacturers asking The mind boggles  I have transferred car accident footage reviewed and edited camera footage stored extra data all with the micro SD But theres an app for that I imagine the manufacturers blubbering Right so you want me to use your bloated unstable privacy invading ad serving mess over a simple micro SD card  Dual sims while not gone they seem to not be so popular anymore Which is a crying shame dual sims are a godsend for anyone who travels for business Hell remember when the second sim slot doubled up as a micro SD slot  Radio the chips can do it at least the Snapdragon 835s and 845s could and I know my Z1 Compact had a radio but it seems that manufacturers dont wire it into their phones anymore Now I gotta use data to stream radio through a 4G LTE connection that doesnt reach weird corners of my home and cuts out when I go into a tunnel NOICE Progress is GREAT  Prices the iPhone 11 pro is US999 The Samsung Note 10 US945 I only bought the Pixel 3 because it was on discount pending the Pixel 4s release Who spends US1000 on a device with a nonuserserviceable battery that will have to be replaced in 2 years Thats laptop money  Is there a market for people like meAm I asking the world here I could easily give up a few features for another but compactness decent battery life waterproofing a headphone jack and affordability are all pretty high up on the wishlist And the worst part is these features used to exist in commercially available phones Manufacturers arent that stupid They will chase trends they think will sell carve out niches they think they can corner and have entire teams dedicated to market research and feature development to get them there But something is wrong here because my impression is that what the mainstream wants is a thin fragile giant 65 screen phone with a notch on the front hairthin bezels which they will need to buy a pair of airpod lookalikes for that will be covered in a thick protective case and a pop socket which will maybe last until lunchtime which they will throw away next year Am I SOL Is there a market for me I see people complain about these things all the time but I guess were not putting our money where our mouth is because manufacturers arent serving us  Please I have some money and I wish to exchange it for awesome and exciting goods and services  Just as a footnote it was eyerollingly depressing to watch Ivy Ross on Googles stream yesterday going on and on about sustainability being one of the most fundamental challenges of our generation only to have her talk about the recycled plastic used in the construction of the fabric in their Nest speaker Lady we throw away our phones every 2 years because there is no alternative to repair or upgrade when your phones are literally glued into place And this happens at a global scale One of your lines was what if you didnt need to upgrade a bulky new game console every few yearshttpsyoutubeXKmsYB54zBkt1138 and your segueway was into promoting Stadia I understand thats your job and I dont begrudge you toeing the company line but goddamn that is some high level mental gymnastics going on","156":"Just switched to a pixel 7 from a 5a.I only did this because my 5as screen broke and wouldnt turn on I didnt want to really go through the faff of replacing the screen So here are some things I noted after I bought it I really like the design of this phone It feels much more distinct with that camera bar design And not sure if anyone has mentioned it but the lack of rounded corners is a huge win in my opinion I dont have much of a problem with rounded corners but a boxier look is what I prefermakes it feel like a note phone to me just without the stylus Also the centred holepunch is better than a corner one as it makes my screenshots look better lol I bought it in white so thats also a plus considering the boring black I had before Display is obviously an upgrade at least in the refresh rate Though I dont get why the boosted colour profile isnt available I dont hate adaptive but its far too saturated for someone who takes a decent amount of photos and does digital art and wants some colour accuracy Natural is just too undersaturated for me Battery life is a bit of a downgrade in comparison to what Im coming from My pixel 5a was a champ at battery life On a full charge it could last me 68 hours at least on WiFi The pixel 7 gets me 56 hours Which isnt really a deal breaker but its not super impressive Then again at least I get in return a much brighter and high refresh rate display Camera is awesome but that is kind of expected considering its a Pixel And its not much of an upgrade quality wise Though I do like the big sensor for the extra light gathering Video is definitely an improvement and it makes me feel more confident in recording them Im yet to test the new features like cinematic mode and Motion mode though As for Tensor G2 I dont care much about the performance or benchmarks as much as the features it enables Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur are really useful to me And the speech to text is crazy fast I try to use it as much as possible over typingAre there any drawbacks coming from the 5a Yes I really miss the fingerprint reader on the back It was in a good position it was fast and reliable that doubled as my notification shade pull down In display fingerprint readers just arent doing it for me Its not even the speed But the reliability isnt too good compared to what I came from Often it takes a few tries to unlock it even with registering twice And you cant use it if you dont wake up your phone unless you use AOD which I dont I wish they used an Ultrasonic one like Samsung why is that type of sensor only being used by them goddamnit AI based face unlock is good enough though And I also miss the headphone jack Now its not a huge deal breaker for me like some people But it was just nice to have one for convenience sake when I do want to use my wired earphones I still mostly use wireless earphones though so whatever Plus I have a decent USBC dongleBut otherwise yeah I really love this phone","157":"Google Pixel Buds Pro vs Apple AirPods Pro  Which One To Buy.Google Pixel Buds Pro vs

Buds Pro cases next its easy to tell which Apple has always been white and shiny Since its debut Google has used an offwhite matte finish Both cases allow wireless charging and use USB for cable charging Neither has a large battery in terms of capacity any variation in charging time is minorThe significant distinction here is on paper Google claims that with ANC turned off youll get 11 hours of listening time and seven hours with it set on Apples estimates differ slightlyIt claims 45 hours on a single charge up to 5 if ANC and transparency are turned offWhen you put the Pixel Buds Pro back in the charging case youll receive 31 hours of listening time with ANC turned off and 20 hours with ANC switched on If you recharge the AirPods Pro using the case Apple claims more than 24 hours of listening timeThe Pixel Buds Pro and the AirPods Pro claim an hour of music playback with only 5 minutes in the case And after scrambling to power everything up on my 20minute journey to the gym Ive discovered thats plenty for a 90minute workoutPixel Buds pro vs Airpods Pro  Buds DesignThis is subjective but we believe the Pixel Buds Pro is more appealing and durable Google sells its buds in four different shades Lemongrass coral and charcoal Most userslike the Pixel Bud Pros lowprofile design and robust build quality over the AirPods Pros single color selection Theyre IPX4rated for sweat and water resistance and come with an IPX2rated charging caseThe comfort is excellent but the fit is loose AlsoGoogles Eartip Seal Test is often wrong The lack of builtin wings on the Pixel Buds 2 is a Pixel Buds Pro design flawApple made significant improvements to the design of the AirPods Pro including thinner stems inserted ear tips and IPX4 sweat and water resistant certification According to the Ear Tip Fit Test Apples tips establish a tight seal These buds also stay comfortably on the concha for lengthy periods Unfortunately the build quality is inferior to that of other wireless earbuds resulting in occasional cracks and scratches The same may be stated with the portable charging casePixel Buds pro vs Airpods ProFit  ComfortThis has been the most noticeable change between the AirPods Pro and Pixel Buds Pro for many consumers They have various patterns and feel highly different in the ears The AirPods Pro feels slightly lower in the ear canal with the default tips with a tighter seal They just feel more at ease in there Thats not to say they cant wiggle free Whatever face does in the middle of a set at the gym changes the pressure  loosens things up However when you do a challenging elliptical sweaty event you must repeatedly push a bud back inAside from that the AirPods Pro is reasonably straightforward to slip into each ear and stay securely in place as are Googles Pixel Buds Pro In reality both pairs of earbudsremainsecurely inthe ears and all attempts to shake them off by walking running or headbanging will failThe main distinction between the two is how Google and Apple have designed their earphones to fit The AirPods Pro is largely in your ear with each bud having a protruding stem On the other hand Pixel Buds Pro is put straight into your ear and kept in place by the ear tips and the curve of your earSound QualityThe Pixel Buds Pro has improved over its predecessors Howeverthe Apple AirPods Pro features a larger soundstage and easyaccess spatial audioHowever the sound quality on the Pixel Buds Pro is substantially better Google integrated their allnew bespoke 6core audio engine with an 11mm driver for dynamic results The frequency range is excellent and Googles sound profile handles powerful bass performance better than expected The Volume EQ boosts the bass and treble frequencies when listening at low levels A fiveband EQ and spatial audio will be available later this yearThe AirPods Pro on the other hand exceeds sonic standards with a warm broad soundstage that allows you can hear instruments and singers more clearly The bass is amplified to give music tracks additional punch Users may customize the sound on their iPhone by choosing from over 20 presetsFurthermore these buds provide spatial audio straight out of the box For those unfamiliar with the technology it generates a realistic 3D sound that can be heard on certain Apple Music songs and Dolby Atmosenabled films Users may also share audio with a second set of H1equipped AppleBeats headphones or earbudsGestures  ControlsEach Pixel Buds Pro bud has a rounded outer surface that provides more than just color to the device It also works to generate a surprising number of intuitive touch movementsWith a few touches or a tapandhold you can easily playpause skip go back enable noise cancellation and answer phone calls You can change the volume simply by swiping your finger forward or backward over the surface Because the touch area is rather big getting these movements incorrect is also challengingThe AirPods Pro on the other hand can accomplish most of the same easy tasks owing to a pressuresensitive button on the stem That is everything but volume control Apple advises utilizing Siri or changing your phones volume settings on an iPhone The AirPods Pro demands a more accurate twofinger pinch than the Pixel Buds series singlefinger tap Moreover depending on the angle at which the AirPods Pro is inserted into your ear reaching the stem might be complex These are mainly minor quibbles and they should be overcome with experienceWith all that in mind its simple to argue that Google has designed the most excellent gesture control system for headphones available today The AirPods Pro is undoubtedly capable but when compared to the Pixel Buds Pro there is an obvious winnerPixel Buds pro vs Airpods Pro  Battery lifeIn terms of battery life Google easily outperforms Apple The Pixel Buds Pro has a 7hour ANC playtime 25 hours longer than the AirPods Pro By disabling the function you can play for an additional 11 hours When ANC is turned off the AirPods Pro only adds 30 minutes to your battery life Furthermore Googles charging case contains more portable power depending on how you utilize their buds The AirPods Pro has a maximum battery life of 24 hours All of these cases support wireless charging and rapid chargingGoogle oddly did not provide a charging wire with the Pixel Buds Pro but it isnt enough of a detractor to deny the Pixel Buds this victoryDo Pixel Buds Pro work with iPhoneThey are compatible with any standard Bluetooth device including PCs and iPhones but contain Androidspecific functionsIs it worth getting Airpod pros with AndroidMost crucially the two main enhancements that make the new AirPods Pro the bestsounding AirPods arenoise cancellation  transparency mode whichoperates well on AndroidConclusionIts pretty challenging to choose between the Pixel Buds Pro vsAirPods Pro As youd anticipate both buds excel in different areas and which one you should choose is essentially a question of prioritiesThe AirPods Pro is an obvious recommendation if you want to hear every minute detail of your favorite tunes while blocking out the most outside noise Googles Pixel Buds Pro is an excellent choice if you want a more relaxed music experience with superior comfort and simple controlsMeanwhile if you want your earphones to include innovative capabilities and interface with your phones speech assistant there is just one option Pixel Buds Pro is the most excellent option for Android consumers while AirPods Pro is ideal for Apple enthusiastsRead MoreSamsung Galaxy Buds 2 Review

I have owned all of the Pixels as well as Samsung S3 S5  S7  S8 iPhone X and other phones going back to the OG HTC Evo I do use Android for personal and iOS for workI picked up a Pixel 4 at 400 off during Black Friday as 16mo was too tempting for me to pass up even though I do already have a 3 Ive watched and read countless Pixel 4 reviews and my comparison below is for those who are in a similar boatx200B1 Display  Pixel 3 80    Pixel 4 85   1 My Orange 4s display is warmer comparable in brightness but otherwise still pleasing whereas my 3 and my wifes 3 are both calibrated with a cooler temp   2 Viewing angles and color shift is mild and comparable between the two   3 As a 144hz PC guy 90Hz on a phone is the real deal as its really smooth and satisfying to scroll around The 4s rounded edges are significantly more rounded compared to the 3 so it squishes the quick setting pulldown icons at the top2 Unlocking  Pixel 3 fingerprint 90    Pixel 4 face 85   1 The fingerprint reader on the 3 is still awesome but even with Motion Sense radar turned off the 4 is still pretty fast at unlocking and getting right into the phone without having to swipe or anything It does work in most lighting but sometimes Ive had to try more than once in pitch black while in bed   2 The eyes closed face unlock issue is silly to me  you can fingerprint unlock the 3 with your eyes closed too or when the person is asleep you can place the phone on someones finger and access the phone This biometric locking is good for a layer of security for using your phone regularly while not having to punch in codes or patterns and its a good first defense if your phone is left unattended or stolen Its not meant to be a bulletproof security feature As a side note you can add the Lockdown option in the power button menu to disable biometric unlock and require the user to enter in the pin or pattern to unlock the phone the next time   3 Some apps have updated to use face unlock Bank of America but some still havent Paypal Not a deal breaker and I imagine there will eventually be parity but its still not there yet3 Camera  Pixel 3 90    Pixel 4  90   1 This is obviously subjective and theyre both providing virtually identical experiences I have AB compared normal pics zoomed in pics and 4K videos and theyre all pretty close between the two phones The 4 is still a great camera but it isnt much of an improvement over the 3 and HDR processing still takes a bit of time on the 4   2 Some folks have said that the 4 tends to use a slightly longer exposure time in identical lighting conditions compared to the 3 which leads to blurrier shots and Ive seen this happen a few times in the past few days while indoors As a parent to little kids I wouldnt mind if Google rolled out a fast motion camera mode that lowers the exposure time and cranks up the ISO at the cost of a grainier picture to minimize blurriness of moving kids   3 I probably wont ever take pictures of the sky so Im not really giving the 4 much in the way of credit or bonus points   4 I did pick up a Moment case and wide angle lens and using it with Portrait mode has been kind of amazing The depth and bokeh are still on point but you can get more in the shot and obviously normal wide shots are possible as well4 Overall daily performance  Pixel 3 80    Pixel 4 90   1 Overall my 3 does pretty well in normal daily tasks Its generally smooth though it will sometimes hiccup if I have music playing and I want to take a quick picture but overall its pretty good   2 My 3 definitely chugs in certain situations In my car with Android Auto on Google MapsNavigation running and Spotify playing the music on the 3 absolutely skips and lags as I switch apps and with a rideshare app active the problem is even worse   3 So far in my anecdotal testing the 4 does not have these issues It seems to be solid with whatever I throw at it so it may be a combination of 6 GB of RAM and better RAM management5 Battery Life  Pixel 3 60    Pixel 4 60   1 In a typical day I average around 1620 hours with 4 hours screen on time with my 3 and in two days with a nearly identical setup in terms of launcher apps and usage the 4 seems to be about the same with Motion Sense turned off People have been saying how bad the battery is and if you can only get about 3 hours of SOT over a day that to me is not enough I know that Motion Sense is one of the newly touted features but I dont see myself using it all that often so after a day Ive turned it off   2 Yesterday I hit 16 hours with 5 hours 10 minutes of SOT and also an hour talking on the phone and I was still at 16 before I plugged it in About 6 of those hours were me sleeping however and we all know that battery will drain more if youre out and about and the phone is constantly connecting to various towers   3 Standby time was pretty steady at around 08hour overnight with the 3 and the past two nights it has been about 10hr so its in the same ballpark Not great but not awful either6 Other little things Google Assistant Sound Quality Bells and Whistles  Pixel 3 80    Pixel 4 80   1 EDIT Unlimited Original Quality backup in Google Photos is gone with the 4 This is a huge bummer and Ive lowered the Pixel 4 score from 90 to 80   2 Google Assistant is good on both devices particularly with the squeeze feature Local Assistant is definitely faster on the 4 and but at least for me continued conversation isnt fully working   3 Motion Sense is kind of cool and it seems to work pretty well when switching songs on Spotify I guess I just dont see myself skipping tracks all day long and needing to use this radar feature Its a small win for the 4 in its current form but if Google adds more functionality and it works well it would be a bigger differentiator   4 Live transcribe on the 4 is pretty awesome but I dont know how much Id use it Perhaps in a noisy environment where I dont want to crank the speakers or cant hear well it would be useful   5 The Recorder on the 4 is great though I have an APK for it installed on my 3 and it is working well on both devices   6 Speaker sound quality is good on both phones I honestly dont miss the 3s bottom speaker being directly front facing and the sound seems to be a little better rounded out on the 4 as well   7 Headphone sound quality is comparable between the two at least to my ears directly out to some Shure SE535 earphones Its good not the best but I have no issues with this   8 I havent had any real issues or seen differences in signal strength LTE or WiFi speeds bluetooth connection problems or anything of that nature7 Overall build quality and design  Pixel 3 80    Pixel 4 80   1 My 3 had two warranty issues  the bottom speaker stopped working and then in the refurb there was a speck of dust in the rear camera lens I now have a basically perfect working 3 and overall the build quality is good Button clicks feel good speakers are solid and its a sturdy design in that it survives JerryRigs extreme bend test   2 My 4 doesnt seem to have any issues at the moment but it has only been a few days The buttons feel great to press the matte finish on the sides and back are great and I could totally see myself using this phone without a case while around the house The fragile glass on the top of the 3 pretty much kept me from going caseless On the surface I like the 4s design better but it didnt survive the admittedly extreme bend test that the 3 could withstand so Im giving both phones a solid 8   3 As a side note my wife puts her phone in her back pocket all the time and can sometimes sit down ouch so that alone is a reason for her to stick with a 3 instead of going with the 4Overall unweighted scores  Pixel 3 80    Pixel 4 814Overall the 4 is definitely an iterative upgrade from the 3 Paying full price is probably a nogo unless youre swimming in cash but if you picked it up during Black Friday or you can get a good tradein with an old phone I think its a nice upgrade Daytoday usage with the 90 hz screen along with better RAMmanagement make this phone very enjoyable to use and while Im still in the honeymoon phase I have no regrets picking up this 4","159":"Query Regarding Pixel 3a Wired Sound Quality.Hey guys I am here seeking advice before buying Pixel 3a I actually do like what 3a is offering for its price I just have one doubt in mind that I need to clear before buying it Many reviewers have complained about the bad audio quality from 35 mm jack Is that true I mean how good or bad is it as compared to something like my current phone iphone 7 And does the quality improve if I use wireless earphones sorry if thats a dumb question I am not a techie person I am no audiophile but I like to listen to a lot of music and so I expect my new smartphone to sound atleast better than my current iphone7 which was released almost 3 years before pixel 3 Please help me get over the dilemmaThank you","160":"7 days with pixel buds in Peru.Hi all I am from Lima  Peru I decided not to enter Reddit for a week to test the new pixel buds 2 that I acquired on Friday August 28 around 100 pm The post will be long I think please be patientFirst I must say that the PBs are my second wireless headphones In January of this year I bought the Xiaomi Redmi Airdots whose value in local currency is 69 soles  20 These Redmi Airdots I paired with a Huawei Mate 10 and their use was frustrating Outdoor calls are horrible and the left earbud was constantly disconnecting from the device whether indoors or outdoors Although I must admit that calls in closed places were acceptable In March I found a post in the Xiaomi forums from a user that taught steps to follow to improve the connection  and believe me it improved a lot if before I gave it a rating of 510 now it increased to 70  10 although the calls on the street were still horribleAt the beginning of July they assaulted me yes Lima is an unsafe city fortunately the thief only took my smartphone I kept the Airdots and the Mi Band 4  a few days later I acquired a Xiaomi redmi note 8 I thought that at being from the same brand the hearing aids would pair even better  It wasnt the connection is a bit unstable and my rating of these redmi airdots dropped to 65  10 Sorry if you find it tedious to continue reading my story about other hearing aids but now I start with the pixel budsSince I learned about the FirstGeneration Pixel Buds I fell in love with them I tried many times to buy a pair through ebay Google Store and other means without success but when I found out that a new generation would come out my excitement rose to the maximum But with all this Covid 19 my hopes were dashedFew days after buying my new redmi note 8 I found a local seller who had the PB I could not believe it I contacted him but I was not sure about buying them the reason All the posts here on Reddit that I read totally put me off I told the seller that I would think about it for a while I even made a post asking for advice if it was a good idea or not to buy a pair being me from Peru I really hoped that the new firmware or the new buds colors would improve the experience of many even if it was the minority and yes  the few positive posts or comments encouraged me to buy itI said to myself in case the PB are rubbish I will imagine that they robbed me or I lost the money etc I contacted the seller again we met outside his house 0 and he gave me the product it cost me 900 soles  253 I was very nervous so much that I stayed watching them for an hour without daring to open them I didnt know whether to use them in my home or on the street To hell I said to myself again I opened the box and saw the egg D I was surprised by how good it feels to the touch the premium finish of its manufacture I was even more surprised by how heavy the case  charging egg is and the headphones with its matte finish is a caress for my fingertipsAs soon as I finished the initial configuration I checked the version the entire product was with firmware 297 while I was checking the app I received a call from my friend I thought it was a good idea to test them we talked for 2 hours I had no disconnections or anything similar and best of all my friend listened to me loud and clear it felt very good not to raise my voice practically when using the redmi airdots I was shouting in the street to be heard We finished talking and I tried the music it was unusable I couldnt hear even 10 seconds of song Minutes passed and I didnt even bother I knew that if the PBs had bugs it would be my fault for venturing to buy a product with many negative reviewsI got home I kept testing the audio playback I couldnt hear 20 seconds and everything was cuts cuts and more cuts I used the call again everything was fine the videos on YouTube the synchronization was perfect and curiously they did not have so many cuts when watching videos I entered Netflix specifically Better Call Saul Second Season Chapter 7 whose duration is approximately 42 minutes in that period I had 4 cuts 2 of them were micro cuts that were solved instantly and the other 2 I solved by restarting the bluetooth I said to myself  How is it possible that these headphones are good for calls good or decent for watching videos But not to listen to music Tired and without spirits I put them to charge and leave them unused for 2 hours when I took them out again I realized that it had been updated to version 550 with hope I tried the audio again and  yes the cuts continued In the same app I looked for help on connection  it only guided me from the first step unpairing the pixel buds from the smartphone I did it and a message appeared that had not appeared in the initial configuration it is the following BLUETOOTH CONNECTION  THE CURRENT DEVICE SUPPORTS THE AAC CODEC HOWEVER AAC MAY FAIL TO PLAY SOUND DUE TO COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS YOUR DEVICE AUTOMATICALLY CHANGED TO THE SBC CODECI remembered some posts here that talked about codecs and others Im honest  I dont know much about that but I did remember that before restarting them again in the Bluetooth options of my Redmi Note 8 the pixel buds connected with AAC format appeared And I figured switching from AAC to SBC would be a good sign and you know what IT WORKEDAfter that the pixel buds improved their connection On Saturday 29 I used them from 600 am900 am I had no cut at 1000 am I went out to the street specifically to the most boisterous places with many people throughout Lima I listened to music I spoke without effort by phone from 1000 am to 200 pm I had 6 tiny micro cuts that were automatically solved at 1430 pm if I had many cuts and could not listen to music 1431 pm I tried for a minute to reconnect them but I preferred to put them in the egg case I saw that they only had 20  and 22 battery in each hearing aid I assumed that maybe those small cuts were due to the low load of the headphones or that something was causing interference I was in a commercial area that more closely resembles going out of a concert with a lot of people around walking or selling things on the street by 233 pm They were in the case and 1444 I took them out again each hearing aid had 75 battery I continued listening to music without problems from 244 pm to 400 pm  from 700 pm to 1100 pm only a micro cut tinyOn Sunday I practically did not have any cuts at home I used them at home for several hours and everything was excellentOn Monday I used them in the street around 900 am to 200 pm and I had little interference I got home and charged them for 20 minutes already at night around 800 pm the left earphone was disconnected apparently because the battery was drained before the rightOn Tuesday it rained in Lima I had no interference in the street I used them for several hours All goodFor Wednesday I went to coastal places near the sea the wind was blowing very strong I also used them for hours I only had 2 disconnections interferences I think because of the strong wind but everything was very good In the afternoon I charged them for 20 minutes and had around 70 in both hearing aids but at an hour and twenty the left hearing aid went down to 15 and the right one was at 50 I dont know why although later the right hearing aid began to balance lets say with the leftYesterday Thursday I went out again from 1037 am to 257 pm I had very few cuts but everything was perfectToday I went out to ride a bike unfortunately I could not test it well I left my home around 400 pm in 3 minutes I arrived at an ATM to withdraw money in that time I sent messages by WhatsApp to my girlfriend while driving it worked very well then I kept driving  I called my sister the call was very good all this in less than 12 minutes then I opened Spotify I put on the last album of the strokes and in the middle of The Adults Are Talking the tire got flat I got too angry because I can only ride my bike once a week and I really wanted to test the PBs by riding in the air I had to walk 40 min carrying my bike to the side and the worst thing was that I had interference listening to music maybe 5 or 6 inBrooklyn Bridge to Chorus and that made me even angrier I dont know if it was bad luck or I was already sweaty or because of the roughness and weight when walking caused these interferences Perhaps in the future I will repeat this testTHE ADVANTAGES FOR ME ARE THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE I HAVE HAD THEM FOR MANY HOURS AND HAVE NOT HAD PROBLEMS OR PAIN IN THE EARS I DO NOT PLUG MY EARS AND THAT HELPS FOR CALLS I SPEAK WITHOUT EFFORT WHY I DONT FEEL THAT THE OTHERS ON THE STREET LISTEN TO ME OR SEE ME AS CRAZY SPEAKING ALOUD THE TOUCH CONTROLS ARE EXCELLENT EASY TO SUIT THEM THE VOICE ASSISTANT IS VERY HELPFUL JUST SAYING OK GOOGLE OR HEY GOOGLE OR PRESSING WITHOUT LEAVING AND INDICATING WHAT YOU WIN IS INCREDIBLE IN FACT THATS WHY I WANTED SO MANY PIXEL BUDS BECAUSE OF ITS INTEGRATION WITH GOOGLE ASSISTANTBECAUSE OF MY CURRENT JOB SOMETIMES I CANNOT USE MY OWN PHONE WITH MY HANDS AND THIS REALLY HELPS ME A LOT EVEN MORE THAN LIMA IS AN UNSAFE CITY AND POST PANDEMIA HAS GOTTEN WORSE USE YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOUR HANDS TO SEND A MESSAGE TO YOU GIRLFRIEND FRIENDS OR MAKING CALLS IS VERY IMPORTANT  MIND NOTE I HOPE SOME DAY I CAN TRAVEL TO JAPAN AND I CAN FEEL WHAT A SAFE CITY IS THE VOICE ASSISTANT OR ACTIVATING IT WITH THE OK GOOGLE ON THE STREET WORKS 95 FOR ME SEWES IT DOES NOT WORK WELL BUT I THINK IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE 2 MASKS AND MAYBE THAT IS WHY IT DOES NOT CAPTURE THE MAGIC WORD WELL BUT PRESSING AND HOLDING TO ACTIVATE THE ASSISTANT GOES TO 100 AND INDOORS IF THE VOICE ACTIVATION WORKS 100 THE CALLS ARE VERY GOOD I AM VERY HAPPY THAT NOW IF THEY CAN HEAR ME ON THE STREET  SEVERAL FRIENDS HAVE TOLD ME THEY LISTEN TO ME PERFECTLY AND THAT THE MICROPHONES ARE NOT LIKE AIRPODS OR OTHER BRANDS WITH STICK THE SOUND IS VERY GOOD FOR THOSE WHO SAY IT IS NOT SO STRONG THEY JUST RAISE THE VOLUMEM TO THE PB AND THEIR MOBILE DEVICE THE PB HAVE A GOOD BALANCE WITH THE FIRMWARE 297 THE BASS WERE SUBTLE BUT I COULD NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE NEW FIRMWARE 550 WITH THE INCREASED BASS AND IF IT SHOWSTHE DISADVANTAGES FOR ME ARE THOUGH I SAID ABOVE THAT THE COVER LOOKS PREMIUM TO ME I ALSO FEEL THAT I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF IT LIKE GOLD WITHOUT COVER GOODBYE PIXEL BUDS BY ITSELF I AM A PERSON WHO TAKES CARE OF HIS THINGS MY PREVIOUS HUAWEI IN ALMOST 2 YEARS AND MEDIO NEVER FELL ON THE FLOOR AND ETC I FEEL THAT THESE PIXEL BUDS I MUST TAKE CARE OF THEM LIKE GOLD IT GIVES ME ANXIETY TO THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE I MAY BE DAMAGED EITHER BECAUSE OF MY DIFFICULTY OR BY CHANGING THE CONFIGURATION OR BECAUSE A NEW GOOGLE FIRMWARE APPEARS THAT MALOGUE THE EXPERIENCE SO BY FINISHING WRITING THIS POST I WILL DEACTIVATE THE UPDATES OF FIRMWARE I KNOW THAT I SHOULD NOT GIVE IT A LOT OF IMPORTANCE BUT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE NEVER SPENT ON SUCH EXPENSIVE HEADPHONES I KNOW THAT THINGS DO NOT LAST FOREVER BUT I PRETEND THAT THESE PB LAST FOR 2 OR 3 YEARS I HOPE THERE IS ALREADY CURE FOR COVID BY THAT DATE I AM BRONZE THAT IN MY COUNTRY THERE IS NO GOOGLE STORE HERE IN LIMA THERE ARE APPLESTORE SAMSUNG STORE XIAOMI STORE HUAWEI STORE ETC BUT THERE IS NO GOOGLE STORE I WOULD LIKE IT TO HAVE A PHYSICAL STORE OR SUPPORT FOR MY COUNTRY WITH AVAILABLE TECHNICAL SERVICE IN CASE IT IS BAD OR SIMPLY TO BUY NEW GOOGLE PRODUCTS I WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE A PIXEL 4 OR FUTURE MODELS IN LIMA I REPEAT IT IS HARD TO GET GOOGLE PRODUCTS ALTHOUGH I ADMIT THAT WITH TIME MANY DEVICES LIKE CHROMECAST AND GOOGLE NEST ARE BEING SOLD ANOTHER DISADVANTAGE IS THAT THE BATTERY IS IRREGULAR WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE CASE FOR A LONG TIME AND I USE THEM THEY GIVE ME 4 HOURS 4 HOURS AND A HALF APPROXIMATE I DID THE TEST OF CHARGING THEM 10 MINUTES AND THEY WILL GIVE ME 2 HOURS BUT IN REAL LIFE IT ONLY GAVE ME 1 HOUR AND A HALF  WITH 10 MIN OF CHARGE OF 15 17 THEY RISE TO 74 76 BUT IT ONLY GAVE ME FOR TIME AND TWENTY MINUTES AND THE SOUND OF LOW BATTERY BEGINS WHEN THEY WERE IN THE CASE FOR 30 MIN OR A LITTLE MORE ANYONE WOULD ASSUME THAT YOU WILL HAVE MORE HOURS OF BATTERY LIFE ON WEDNESDAY I MEET THEM FOR 50 MINUTES AND LAST 3 HOURSI USE THE PIXEL BUDS WITH A XIAOMI REDMI NOTE 8 ANDROID 9 VERSION WITH MIUI 11 I KNOW THAT IN A FEW DAYS I WILL HAVE THE NEW MIUI 12 UPDATES BUT I WILL THINK VERY WELL IF I SHOULD UPDATE IT OR NOT I hope I have the freedom to decide I do not want to spoil my experience with these PB I USE BLUETOOTH WITH A MI BAND 4 AND WITH PIXEL BUDS THE AUDIO CODEC IS SBC I HAVE PINNED THE PIXEL BUDS APPLICATION IN THE BACKGROUND I HAVE DISABLED THE AUTOMATIC FIRMWARE UPDATE AND I HAVE DISABLED THE UPDATE OF PLAYSTORE APPLICATIONS I HAVE ENABLED THE BASS REINFORCEMENT I HAVE DISABLED THE EXPERIENCE DETECTION FOR THE LISTENING FUNCTION AND THE LISTENING DETECTION A BABY OR ALARMS ALSO HAVE THEM DISABLED AH AND THE AMBIENT SOUND ALSO HAVE IT DISABLEDTO GO OUT TO THE STREET I USE A MALENTIN  BACKPACK  BACKPACK I HATE CARRYING THINGS IN THE POCKETS OF THE TROUSERS SO I PUT EVERYTHING IN THERE SOMETIMES I CARRY THE BACKPACK FULL AND THE CONNECTION IS VERY GOOD IN MY HOUSE I HAVE NOT WALKED AWAY SO MUCH FROM THE DEVICE TO THE MOST 1 METER OR 2 I IGNORE THAT SUCH IS THE CONNECTION IN LONG DISTANCES I HAVE WEARED A HAT  HOOD AND EVERYTHING WAS PERFECTLYI HAVE NOT USED THE TRANSLATOR I DONT KNOW THAT IT IS THAT GOOD I HAVE NEITHER USED THE PAIRING WITH ANOTHER ANDROID DEVICE OR WITH ANY WINDOWS PC ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKEAPOLOGIZE AGAIN IF I EXCEEDED BUT I REALLY WANTED TO TELL IN DETAIL THIS EXPERIENCE I DIDNT WANT TO OPEN THE BOX TO USE THEM FOR 5 OR 10 MINUTES AND SAY THEY ARE AMAZING EDIT I ALREADY GOT TROUBLE LIKE OTHERS POST THIS THAT YOU READ ME IN ANALYZING THEM I EVEN THINK ILL KEEP DOING IT I WAITED FOR THESE HEARING AIDS FOR MONTHS AND THEY REALLY ARE AMAZING I HOPE I DONT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS I WILL CROSS MY FINGERSMY PERSONAL SCORE FOR THESE PIXEL BUDS IS 910MAYBE IM GIVING YOU A LOT BUT I HAVE NEVER USED A HIGHEND AIRPOD  AIRPOD PRO  JABRA  SONY  ETC MY OTHER OPTION FOR ANDROID WAS THE GALAXY BUDS LIVE OR PLUS BUT AS I SAID HAVE THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT FOR EVERYTHING ITS GREAT I HOPE MORE USERS CAN IMPROVE THEIR CONNECTION I ALSO HOPE THAT THE ASSISTANTS NAME CAN BE CHANGED FOR EXAMPLE OK JARVISI ALSO HOPE THAT THE ASSISTANT CAN SEND AUDIO MESSAGES FOR WHATSAPP TELEGRAM OR ETC WITH THE FIRST CONFIGURATION THE ONE THAT GIVEN ME FAILURES WHEN RECEIVING A NOTIFICATION IT EMITS A SOUND AND SEVERAL SMALL SOUNDS IF IT WAS FROM THE SAME APP WHEN PERFORMING THE SECOND PAIRING SUCCESSFUL THAT NOTIFICATION SOUND STOPPED NOW TO BE ISSUED ASSISTANT TELLS ME WHAT APP NOTIFICATION IS IT IS IT RAREPD1 AH I FORGOT THE PIXEL BUDS I HAVE ARE WHITEPD2 I dont use PBs for gaming latency in videos is fine for mePD3 Sorry for the writing I wrote everything in

for a little over a month now Ive got a regularsized Pixel 4httpswwwandroidcentralcomgooglepixel4preview in orange on order today Let me know what kinds of videos you want to see from me but in the meantime Im going to give you my scorching hot take on how the two of them compare not just in terms of specs but philosophyRead the Pixel 4 handsonhttpswwwandroidcentralcomgooglepixel4previewRead the iPhone 11 reviewhttpswwwimorecomiphone11reviewRead the iPhone 11 Pro reviewhttpswwwimorecomiphone11proreviewDesign  DisplayThe iPhone 11 has a notch just like the iPhone Xstyle phones have had for the last few years now They want to optimize for screen space so theyre taking those extra corners if they can get them Apples stuck with glossy glass on the 11 proper but textured now on the 11 Pro It has a big honking bump with two cameras on the 11 three on the Pro colormatched to the glass color but with gloss and texture inverted The result is what it usually is a phone thats almost a singular objecthttpswwwimorecompixel4vsiphone11whichphoneshouldyougetPixel has a forehead like some Pixels have had before except for the one with last years random notch Theyre optimizing for clean lines and consistency between devices now Googles gone from the twotone to single tone and textured And it also has a big honking bump with two cameras colormatched to the cameras Which means black The result is almost an iPhonestyle singular object but still with a playfully colored power buttoniPhone displays have consistently been great for years and the iPhone 11 LCD and iPhone 11 Pro OLED are no exceptions They use Samsungs process Apples spec calibration and management and theyre some of the best in the business Theyve also had TrueTone ambient color temperature matching for a while now Basically Apple wants consistency across the board All color just handledPixel displays have faced more challenges The Pixel 2 XL display was bad Pixel 3 was much better Pixel 4 is supposed to be excellent Rumor has it theyre also using Samsungs process now but with their own color management and so its quite possible theyre right up there as well And theyve just added Ambient EQ which also matches color temperature So Googles now matching Apple in the color matchingBut the Pixel displays now go up to 90hz with dynamic refresh rates which isnt the 120hz of the iPad Pro lines ProMotion but better than the still 60hz of the iPhone 11s nonProMotionPerformanceThe iPhone 11 has the Apple A13 Bionic systemonachip which Im going to just come out and say is the best mobile silicon on the market today And inserting the word mobile in there is becoming less and less necessary over time Also 4 GB of RAM If benchmarks are your thing it scores 1329 for singlecore and 3411 multicore on Geekbench 5httpswwwimorecompixel4vsiphone11whichphoneshouldyougetApple believes in fully integrated features from the chip to the interface so custom silicon is just an investment that keeps paying off Combined with increased display efficiency and bigger batteries 3110 mAh for the iPhone 11 3046 mAh for the iPhone 11 Pro and 3969 mAh for the iPhone 11 Pro Max it gives all of this years iPhones real allday battery life You can also get up to 512 GB of storage if you like to hoard all the bitsThe Pixel 4 uses Qualcomms Snapdragon 855 Not the 855 but its probably not enough difference for anyone to really care about After getting kicked in the 64bit butt by the A7 Qualcomm has really started pushing again and while I dont think theyre in Apples silicon league yet theyre finally catching up Also 6 GB of RAM which is way up from the previous 4 GB and should make a big difference with AndroidI havent seen any scores for the Pixel 4 but the 855 on the OnePlus 7 Pro tops out at 723 single and 2655 multicore on Geekbench 5 So even if Google works some magic its fair to say theyre not getting close And they have a history of performance degradation over time Fingers crossed thats fixed To make up for the lack of custom SoC Googles working on custom coprocessors More on that in a minute But still it necessitates a modular playThe Pixel 4 has a 2800mAh battery and the Pixel 4 XL 3700mAh Which is kind of worrisome given Pixels have never exactly been known for their battery life to begin with In other words if they last theyre going to have to prove it Also they top out at 128 GB on storageSecurityBy now the iPhones Aseries Secure Enclave and Face ID facial geometry scanner are well known Face ID debuted on the iPhone X and has been made faster with subsequent hardware and software updates including on the iPhone 11 You cant however use it without having to swipe up on the lock screen to openThe Pixel has Googles Titan security chip and a new facial geometry scanner augmented by a MotionSense radar chip And yes there was a huge controversy surrounding how the data was obtained for the face scan so factor that in as you willMuch like Apples new U1 spatial positioning chip in the iPhone 11 Google hasnt said much if anything about what the MotionSense killer feature will be Apple is rumored to be shipping locator tags at some point Until then both are tech demosFor now it will preload the camera for Face unlock and you can use it without having to swipe up on the lock screen to open In fact you have to change a setting if you want the lock screen to linger which makes the experience perceptively fasterCameraApple went from a single wideangle or dual wideangle and telephoto to dual 12mp f18 wideangle and 12mp f24 ultra wideangle on the iPhone 11 with a third 12pm f20 telephoto on the iPhone 11 Pro On the front Apple still has a single selfie camera but its 12mp now with a 70 field of view Basically the iPhone 11 has good camera

with a 90 field of view Basically the Pixel 4 has hohum camera hardware but excellent computeApple has gotten better at fusion and semantics Google at virtual lens modeling and depth data Googles also using a Pixel Neural Core which finally  finally \u00a0gives them the processing power necessary to do live previews of all the computational photography Something the iPhone has done since 2016 The Pixel is just crushing it on computational Super Zoom though which is an area Apple hasnt really focused on yetBoth have computational high dynamic range night mode and astrophotography Which you like better will come down more to subjective factors namely whether you prefer Apple or Googles color science and artistic choices Apple has traditionally gone for a natural look and feel Thats led to warmer tones Google feels like they want scientific accuracy which has led to slightly cooler tones Again its a matter of personal preference at this pointVideo is a different story The iPhone still does 4K 60 fps but now with extended dynamic range Even on the frontfacing camera The Pixel 4 is still tops out at 4K 30 fpsTheres a lot lot more to both cameras of course Ive just posted a huge iPhone 11 camera reviewhttpswwwimorecomiphone11camerareview and my colleagues at Android Central are no doubt working on the same for the Pixel 4PricingThe iPhone 11 includes Lightning earbuds in the box but no 35mm adapter The regular version starts at 699 the Pro at 999 and the Pro Max at 1099 And its available pretty much everywhereThe Pixel 4 has no earphones or adapters in the box The regular version starts at 799 and the XL at 899 And its got better US carrier availability this time but due to regulatory issues wont be available in India when it goes on sale elsewhere on October 24 VECTOR

iPhone 3 I think so its been a long time Ive always liked the flexibility of Android plus the fact that Googles ecosystem isnt closedmeaning in theory I could switch to iPhone at any time without too much hassleBut my Pixel 7 had been giving me headaches especially with Google Messages failing to receive texts in group chats I dont know if it was the phone or my carrier but after months of frustration I finally gave in Seeing the sheer number of iPhones around me plus the way Apple is constantly hyped up in media I figuredwhy not Maybe I was missing outSo a week ago I used an upgrade from my carrier to get the iPhone 16 Pro Here are my thoughts so far How I Use My PhoneI use my phone for both work and personal life and a lot of that involves typingemails messaging across multiple apps etc I rely on crossplatform apps like WhatsApp Gmail Outlook Salesforce and many Google services Google News Drive Keep Gmail Maps YouTube Music etc The Good Hardware Quality A really nice piece of hardware Beautiful solid and feels great in hand The Pro model is a good sizebig but not too bulky Screen Looks fantastic No complaints Camera  Video Takes excellent shots and from all accounts the video quality is toptier Dynamic Island First time hearing about it but its actually pretty cool Having sports scores and music controls right there is surprisingly useful Software Touches Some effects and animations are really smoothlike when scanning a document it isolates the background and seamlessly moves it into the corner CarPlay This surprised me When catching up on notifications it gives a naturallanguage summary of missed messages which is really nice    The Apple Maps navigation voice and style is very natural and smoothI actually prefer it to Google Maps I guess the days of being navigated into a lake are over for Apple Maps Grouped Notifications While I still think Android does notifications better Apples grouping and summarization of sameapp notifications is intelligently designed and useful FaceID When youre holding the phone FaceID works perfectlyfast and accurate However if the phone is sitting on a desk or table FaceID often wont pick up your face unless you awkwardly lean over it A fingerprint reader would be a really nice option in those situations Standby Mode Standby mode at night with the bedside alarm clock in red was actually very nice and welldesigned Its subtle but easy to read at night without being harsh on the eyes Also the default iPhone alarm tone is exceptionally pleasingway better than the jarring tones Im used to on Android GenMoji Seems Fun I didnt even try it once but I bet its cool for those who are into that sort of thing The BadThese arent new complaints about iOS but for someone using it as a main device they are massive hurdles The Keyboard is Borderline Unusable Whether using the stock keyboard or Gboard on iOS the experience is awful So many typos wrong key pressesits just bad The Gboard on my old Pixel 7 was 1000x more accurate and faster to type on It has been consistently infuriating I had no idea just how much better the Android keyboard was Notifications  Anxiety Machine iPhone is aggressive with notificationsway more than I was used to On Android you can easily choose which notifications for a given app should be silent or not right from the notification itselfjust a quick tap and done On iPhone its a much more laborious process requiring you to dig into settings manually for each app This makes it way harder to finetune notifications to be useful instead of overwhelming Speaking of Settings Why is there a whole app called Settings instead of just swiping down and tapping an icon to adjust things quickly Having to navigate through an app for simple things like WiFi or Bluetooth is an unnecessary step No App Drawer This is insane Instead of a clean app drawer you have to either search for apps which is fine but not intuitive or look through Apples premade categories in the App Library The grouping seems neat at first glance but ends up being a wild choice in actual use Why do I have to rely on Apple to decide where my apps go CarPlay Layout is a Mess Apple Maps is actually pretty solid nownaturalsounding navigation accurate directionsbut the overall CarPlay interface is clunky compared to Android Auto    If you use Google Maps on CarPlay without a car screen just on your phone you can only get inapp media controls for Spotify or Apple Musicnot YouTube Music Why iMessage is Seriously Underwhelming I was expecting more RCS on Android does the same thing minus the blue bubble exclusivity so the fact that Apple has built an entire bullying ecosystem around this feels ridiculous WhatsApp does all of this and works across devices    No iMessage on a PC This was a shock I use a PC for work and I was stunned to realize that iMessage has no web or Windows version With Google Messages WhatsApp or basically any other modern messaging platform I could just open a browser and continue conversations while working With iPhone Nope Either use a Mac or be stuck switching between my phone and computer constantly Transferring Old Messages From Android Was a Nightmare This was infuriating Theres no native way to do it so I had to try a thirdparty expensive appand even that still didnt work Homescreen Organization is a Disaster On Android I can place apps and widgets where I wantmaybe I have a family photo as my wallpaper and dont want anything covering faces On iPhone Move one app and the whole homescreen shifts like a chaotic game of Tetris If you try to put an app in a folder its like chasing a toddler at bedtime Just why Final Verdict For NowAll of my complaints seem like they should be obvious to anyone who uses a phone regularly and heavily The keyboard alone makes the iPhone unusable for anyone who has used a functional mobile keyboard before The homescreen mess the notifications anxiety and the lack of a proper back gesture all add up to an experience that feels polished but deeply inefficientSo it appears Ill be switching back to Androidand a Pixel 9 Pro Im sure Ill still have complaints and yeah I know some grown adults will keep whining about green bubbles But whatever I need to get stuff doneWould love to hear from others who made the switch either way Did you stick with it or go back Does anybody ever switch any more","164":"Why im saying goodbye to Pixel after almost 10 years  .Hey Pixel ownersJust wanted to share my experience using Google phones for a decade and also why i decided to give another brand a try for now TLDR I feel like ive been a beta tester for google since the Pixel 6 and upwardsIve been using google phones since the Nexus 6P and instantly fell in love with them The camera of the 6P was ahead of its time especially the ease of use My previous phones were Galaxies and these camera apps always had me take 4 or 5 pics before i snapped the right shot the 6P just made it into a one hit wonder I also loved the clean Android feel and seeing Android be improved to what it is today was an amazing journey Google phones i owned Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel 2 XL the panda 3 Pixel 3 Pixel 4 Pixel 3 again I loved the size Pixel 6  Pixel 8 and pixel watch  budsMy experience with Pixel phones has been outstanding especially in the beginning I was a BIG advocate of using Pixels and shilled them a lot They were a bit hard to come by in Holland at first so id import them Such great phones though I bought a Pixel 4 for my Mom that still works to this day No lag just smooth as butter I also loved the google ecosystem and the design language I still do I think android has really matured and is in so many ways pushing the envelope in smartphone OS development Im trying a different brand now but i do miss a lot of the features that android offers Its so smooth and navigating the phone is superb Universal back gesture now playing flip to DnD flick your wrist to reverse to selfie cam So many nifty ways to interact with your phone i love itThere has been a but in this story for me unfortunately Ever since the Pixel 6 the road has gotten a bit bumpy for me The 6 had strange issues would have excessive battery drain get really hot and have software bugs like apps hanging I loved these phones for the stability and this was getting a bit of an issue Maybe i was just unluckyI hoped it was a 6 issue so i upgraded to the regular 8  pixel watch 2 and this is were it really got crappy for me on the hardware spectrum The 8 had a few software issues like apps hanging when multitasking that i could live with but the hardware started failing me while traveling Japan First my Pixel Watch 2 just stopped charging and died on me out of the blue and a month later my Pixel 8 started getting a weird green screen issue tens of times a day the screen would just turn green and spaz out for a minute Very inconvenient when youre on a Japanese train station trying to figure out where to go Combine that with google maps hanging a lot when in PIP mode and it was beginning to become an annoyance to use the P8 on the roadGoogle supports solution was for them to send the phone in for repair which would mean i would be without a phone for 23 weeks so i was forced to buy a phone in Japan to travel without hassle I realised i kinda lost faith in the stability of my pixel because of my 6 and 8 experience so i decided to switch sides And i feel a bit sad to leave the Pixels behind to be honest I genuinely love these phones ive captured many great memories with em and theyve accompanied me on so many great adventures and never let me down Until recentlyNow having joined the other side still feels weird Its a gorgeous device to look at but i dont think the other brand has a better operating system and in lots of ways i miss my pixels ease of use Switching was not that difficult so i will definitely be back in the future but i really want Google to deliver a more stable hardware experience firstI feel like ive been a beta tester with these last 2 Pixels To get a support solution that involves not having my phone for 2 weeks is also very unsatisfactory And strange as my watch WAS able to be exchanged  but the watch is not really something i cant travel withoutI feel like with googles ambitions being upscaled theyre also upscaling some of the woes these phones have and its reflecting on the quality of my experiences I really hope the 9 will be a succes and makes me wanna jump back into the Pixel experience but i think im gonna skip a few generations Itll be good to fall in love with em again Anyway first world problems eh","165":"Is a Pixel phone worth it if I am not heavily invested in the Google app ecosystem.My current phone a Moto G Power is getting very laggy and at times just stuck such that I have to completely restart it to get out of whatever screen Im on Im looking to upgrade soon and I am considering the Pixel 8 or 8a likely 8a because the camera quality battery life continued updates for many years and good overall specs are attractive However I am hesitant to switch over to a Google phone because I pretty much only use Google Photos and the Google Calendar I dont search with Google I dont use Chrome I dont use the Assistant I dont use Docs etc Im also not very proAI and will probably not use the AI features very much though I suppose this depends on how helpful they end up beingIt also seems upon a little bit of research that you cannot get rid of the Google search bar at the bottom of the home screen which is a concern for me because I value customizability very much and dont search with Google anyhow Is this still the case If so I will have to opt for a different phone right now my second contender is the OnePlus 12RMy main question here is does the phone itself stand up when not very invested in the Google app ecosystem And as a subissue does it offer decent customization options or push you into using Google","166":"I ordered my galaxy watch 6  I own a pixel 7 phone i learn more that some of the features will not be available outside the galaxy ecosystem Any list on what are those features that will not be accessible And is it worth it to buy the galaxy watch owing a pixel phone .Pixel watch is not launched in India and i dont think so they will launch the pixel watch 2 too","167":"iPhone X Pixel 2 XL Note 8a poor mans review.I am not a rich man I cant just go out and buy a new piece of tech every day like all of my favorite YouTubers There has to be research involvedI need to know what Im buying will keep me happy for longer than the 14 day return period So with 3 topend phones in my crosshairs the iPhone X the Pixel 2XL and the Note 8 I drudged through pages and pages of reddit reviews watched hours of video commentary and came to one conclusion I have no idea what phone to buy so why not try out all 3 Since Im a man of limited means Id have to try them out one at a time I started the upgrade process on my account and set my sights on the first prize the iPhone X  Xtra screen Xtra priceyThe iPhone X is arguably the most beautiful slab of glass and stainless steel Ive ever held in my hands The weight of the phone lets you know youve spent money on something well built I felt like when I had this thing out showing it off I was the center of attentionusually because I was It is a near perfect monument of what the path to the perfect iPhone has been for Apple The screen alone almost makes the phone worth it with its vivid punchy colors and amazing brightness The screen almost looks TOO good Like you can reach in and touch the icons The notch while noticeable for about 3 minutes just melts away I only noticed it when a video zoomed in past its pillar boxes Even then the notch didnt seem to upset me What did upset me was learning the gestures Some of them make sense swiping up from the bottom to close an app for instance But others like getting to the background apps felt slow and clunky And getting to the control center should be easier than it is Its not a one handed operation but I really feel it should be Sure if you have big hands like I do you can stretch your thumb out But if you have small hands its not going to be easy What made iOS great in the past was its simplicity and intuitiveness All of that seems to have been forgotten with the X and iOS 11 What has stayed simple though is Apples top notch bio metricsFaceID sounds like a bigger gimmick than square hamburger patties at Wendys I mean Android has had this for years right Wrong FaceID was easy to set up and quick to unlock The amazing subtle features that come with FaceID like hiding notifications on the lock screen until the phone recognizes you is just amazing I liked that I didnt have to position my face in some weird pose or angle for it to work either It just worked and thats what Apple people know and love Animojiswhile an even bigger gimmick were fun to play around with and really showcases what that front camera is capable of Speaking of Cameras both cameras did great the pics looked decently colored and I really love iOSs live photos with 3D touch Its about the only thing I used 3D touch for and its done well The video recording was very well done with 4k  60FPS being its biggest highlight The only thing I thought that wasnt well done was the OISto be honest I had to double check to make sure the phone HAD OIS because it didnt feel like it Hopefully that gets fixed in a software update Overall though the cameras can hold their own with the best that Android has to offer However after using the phone for a little bit I really felt cheated I was not seeing the smooth as silk iOS I had been told of for many years I was not getting top of the line battery life from a 1100 phone And as an android user for the last 6 years things just felt clunky navigating around the OS I missed things Ive taken for granted for years like my notifications with LEDs AOD and setting my own default apps Some of these things I could get adjusted to and I realize iOS 11 is going through a rough patch But all in all it just wasnt feeling like I could justify purchasing the X and telling myself to adapt to my phone instead of my phone adapting to meLets go back to the Android basics 2 XL styleBeing on ATT I couldnt just go into the store and subsidize a Pixel 2 XL That alone bugs me I HATE carrier exclusive phones Yes I know I can buy the phone direct from Google and thats good But theres something nice about going to a carrier store picking up the phone you want right there and walking out paying only sales tax with a big bill later Lucky for me one of my friends owns a shiney new Pixel 2 XL and let me play with it for a day Holy bananas this phone is snappyno snappy isnt good enough Its itsGoogle needs to invent a new word for how fast this phone feels Ive been on the Samsung train for most of my Android life with the Oneone and the Nexus 6 being the only two exceptions I honestly thought that the whole skipping frames and sluggishness you read about on the I hate Samsung train that is rAndroid was a bunch of nonsense Even my S7Edge felt fine to me No real slowdowns or anything Nope I was wrong WAAAAAY wrong The Pixel 2 XL felt like I had stepped out of a Toyota Corolla and into a Ferrari My friend laughed as I scrolled through the app drawer for minutes just saying its sooo smooth  From one Samsung fanboy to the rest of you out there your phone is slow you just dont realize it The camera was the other area this phone just steps out into its own I could not get it to take a bad photo to save my life Putting it against my other coworkers iPhone 8 she was even blown away by how the photos looked just like real life I briefly tried out the video functionality and cannot figure out how this camera manages to make better videos than phones with dual lens setups and OIS on everything except the user itself My only complaint about the camera was I didnt have a lot of shooting mode options Everything was very basic with just a couple of modes Google keeping it simple for the user definitely works for a lot of people but I do like having options like a manual modeThe Pixel 2s biggest controversy since its release is its less than stellar screen Once again coming from Samsung and even playing with the iPhone X I think Im a pretty good judge  when it comes to OLED displays I have almost nothing bad to say about the 2 XLs display The blueshift on the phone I tested didnt stand out to me as anything bad and really felt overblown especially when looking at other OLEDs I checked for light bleed and didnt see any And while my friends 2 XL is only a week old I didnt see any burn in or image retention but he does keep the brightness in check so as to not suffer the wrath of the burn in gods  Speaking of brightness this seems to be my only gripe with the screen At max brightness it just barely seemed to hang in there especially in direct sunlight While I could see what was on screen dark colors just merged together and details cant stand out Out of the 3 phones I tested this was by far the darkest screen Its great for indoors but I wasnt overly thrilled taking it outside   Now I fully admit I dont get the religious Pure Android or nothing attitude I see on Reddit I think OEM skins arent just nice but vital to forcing Google to incorporate the best of each skin into new iterations of Android AOD Multiapp display and a ton of other features in Android are thanks to LG Samsung and all the others out there pushing the limits of their vision of Android  That being said simple Android is pretty easy to use and Id even argue maybe even easier to use than iOS lately After tinkering with the 2 XL I can definitely see the appeal but I do and always will love feature rich skins that provide users with an even more engrossing and productive experience A noteworthy experience but can it lastMy final phone tested was the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 This phone is so big I had to get permits from the city just to let me put it in my house I kid but while expensive the Note 8 will at least leave you with the feeling you got a LOT for your money And you really do too That pen just keeps getting smarter every iteration of the Note line With it being able to do text translations and live messaging its a gimmick feature that I kept finding myself going back to I was looking for excuses to pull out the pen and do new things on the screenthat gorgeous beautiful screen Picasso once said Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot others transform a yellow spot into the sun Samsung has managed to create not another copy of an OLED display but THE OLED display for others to copy What the Note 8 lacks in fluidity and it does it makes up for in the most stunning display and feature rich experience in all of the 3 phones I tested From app pairing to cutting out sections of the screen drawing notes and then texting them faster than it took for me to write this sentence the Note 8 has abilities that would make a swiss army knife blush I was finding new things to do with the phone every time I picked it up Its almost overwhelming And therein lies the problem with Samsung vs Android purists Samsung weighs itself down with a constant influx of features at the expense of ram and processing power THANKFULLY Im happy to say that the Note 8 experience was a smooth one Not NEARLY as smooth as the Pixel 2 XL but Samsung has made ungodly strides in improving performance and it shows in the Note 8 Thats not to say there werent the occasional frame drop here and there now that I know what to look for with my Pixel experience I can hear what youre thinking Smooth now but give it a month or two and I would agree with you My Galaxy S6 was probably the worst offender in recent memory However I was able to compare the new Note 8 in my hand to another coworkers Note 8 theyve had since launch Everything seemed to be identical in terms of smoothness and the benchmarks were practically the same I tried to break both phones bogging them down with running apps music and video But to my surprise both phones held steady What didnt hold steady was the battery life I found it to be just barely ok I think that with quick charge we are becoming accustomed to fast charging top offs at the expense of sub par battery life Samsung really needs to address this in the next Note phone because a productivity phone that you use during the work day SHOULD be able to get you through the work day without the feeling of panic by 2 PM I hope Samsung shakes off the PTSD they gained from the Note 7 disaster We need battery innovation and the Note 8 is a great example of why Camera wise the Note 8 took great photos for a normal guy like myself But the iPhone X did a  better job and the 2 XL blew both of them out of the water The one area I felt the Note 8 shined over the other 2 was in video recording The image stabilization was excellent on the Note as well as the recorded sound quality While the iPhone Xs recorded sound was very quiet and the 2 XLs was very tinny the Note 8 had a very good balance of audio quality and ambient noise reduction This surprised me since I didnt think Samsung cared about sound because the Note comes with a single bottom firing speakerits 2017 Samsung stereo speakers are a thing Im sorry for yelling Samsungplease dont kill off the headphone jack Ok OkTLDR what did I pick While beautiful I couldnt get myself used to the Apple ecosystem so the X was out The 2 XL cant be purchasedsubsidized through ATTs Next program and I refuse to switch to Verizon so that was out Which leaves me with the Note 8 I loved all three phones for plenty of reasons and you CANT go wrong with any of them The iPhone X is a beautifulBEAUTIFUL work of art the Pixel 2 XL is a purist dream come true that is faster than any phone Ive ever played with and the Note 8 is a treasure trove of features and a display that will melt your eyes with its beauty  I count myself lucky to live in an age of these beautiful devices and am fortunate to be able to own one

Especially the back and the camera lens area My daughter threw it a couple times out of frustration she struggles with sensory disorder so thats why shes a little aggressive and the back of my iPhone which is made out of flippin glass not to my surprise shattered Like of course it would bc its made of such a fragile material Yes I had a case on it Well honestly as soon as I saw how bad the damage was I already was drooling at the thought of leaving apple After all back in the day like 15 years ago my first phone was not an iPhone I was always an android girly I believe I got my first iPhone when I was in college I am 30 now and I did have an android cheapie phone 1 time between college and now for ahsort time but mostly it was apple and mostly i stayed with them bc all my family had apple and my husband too But secretly I always liked android way better So I talked to my husband and said look this is more expensive to repair than just buying a new android type phone they are not as expensive as apple He begrudgingly accepted my wish to purchase a new phone and I began my research Many videos and articles later I chose the Google Pixel 8a Everyone was saying its your best bang for your buck and theres not many differences between this cheaper model than the pro model more on that laterwould like to know your thoughts So I bought the phone I also decided to buy a Galaxy watch 6 to go with it as I need a watch I am used to using an appe watch daily I was gonna do the pixel watch but it looked like it was really lacking in features and it had not great reviews I would have loved to go with that so that it was seamless integration but oh well this GW6 works pretty near seamlessly I am thoroughly enjoying my new androidGoogle ecosystem of technology I really love it

Google for creating such an impressive device","177":"Pixel 9 Pro XL is Amazing.I just gotta come here and express my gratitude towards Google for actually fixing and changing the many issues with their previous devices To preface Ive been a long time iPhone user who dabbles with the android ecosystem I used to flipflop back and forth each year between Apple and Google up until the Pixel 4 but then I felt like googles devices couldnt keep up with some of the hardware Apple uses on their devices Most recently I really tried to love the P8P but there was so many issues I couldnt see past that would degrade the experience of the device As with my job I cant really be near a charger at all times one of my main issues was the terrible battery life of the Pixel 8 Pro I wouldnt even make it through an 810 hour shift comfortably with the Pixel 8 Pro And it wasnt solely for screen on time but mainly standby time that was the culprit Of course screen time would degrade my battery life even quicker but as it was in my pocket for a few hours and Id go back onto my phone seeing that it lost 15 percent battery life was extremely unsettling Id constantly limit background usage turn 5G off an use LTE strictly turn off location services And although that helped slightly I dont believe you should limit your phone in a bunch of different ways to be able to prolong battery lifeI always also experienced laggingstuttering issues with the 8 Pro This issue is self explanatory and not much to say other than it seriously degraded the experience of using the phoneOverheating Yeah that was an issue constantly Id be using maps on my car and my phone would have an overheating warning In direct sunlight Id have an overheating warning Etc it was just a constant battle The modem on the 8 Pro was AWFUL Such spotty service dropped calls and again limiting to LTE instead of 5G just to have improvements on the battery life Now with the P9PXL oh my what a drastic difference And of course this is my experience with the device but battery has been amazing The standby times have been excellent no need to limit background usage limit to LTE turn down screen resolution Yesterday I had over 4 hours SOT and the device was still at 50 ish percent battery life by the time I got home I was using the camera maps daily texting phone calls emails social media and this device just handled it so well The modem is crazy good Id argue better than apples I live in the basement of my house and on either the 8 Pro or 15 Pro Max Id get one bar or no bars in my room P9PXL is sitting at 3 bars right now in a room I struggled to have service in Havent experienced a single dropped call using 5G and this modem is killing it allOverheating hasnt been an issue at all This phone remains cool with my usage patterns because of that new vapor chamber Havent had a single overheating issue whether using android auto or just being outside on my deviceStuttering hasnt been an issue at all The UI has been buttery smooth No hiccups or stuttering The new fingerprint sensor works flawlessly Im using a tempered glass screen protector and it just reads my fingerprint without delay Messing around with the add me feature on the camera and the magic eraser its just crazy what AI on a device can do Some of the features are a gimmick in my opinion but some of these features are seriously QOL features With RCS finally available on iPhone well currently to those who have the iOS 18 beta texting between iPhone and Android has been lovely with those read receipts reply features no horribly compressed photosvideos I say this with full confidence but I genuinely feel like this is finally a Pixel year for me Im seriously loving everything about this phone ","178":"Has anyone else noticed it seems like Google has forgotten about the Google Pixel Tablet.It just doesnt seem like Google focuses much on the Google Pixel Tablet and if you look it up online you really dont find much information on it or many people talking about it Ive been using it for a few months now and while its not the fastest Tablet its still really nice in my opinion especially since its Stock Android its basically just like a larger Google Pixel Phone which is really cool and I think its a great addon to my Google Ecosystem I just wish Google gave it more attention and longer Update support Yes I know they might be coming out with a Google Pixel Tablet 2 but I still think this Tablet deserves more attention and longer Update support Thoughts","179":"Switched to pixel 9 pro after 10 years of iPhone help me keep my choice .I love a lot of things about the pixel but as a long time iOS user Im having mild buyers remorse  anxiety I have 8 days left to trade the phone back  Would love some reassurance from longerterm pixel users I will say some stuff I love so far is  Design the Hazel is stellar  Google makes everything easy its well explained and covers most of the bases youd have questions around from switching over  Google ecosystem works great for productivity  Pictures are fun to take and the quality is imo better for the casual enjoyer Customization but wont get into it as everyone knows this already  Google is putting in effort to be consumer friendly while apple recently has been trending opposite Cost to package ratio Some stuff Im having anxiety about  accessories are what I miss most about apple Really liked my Apple watch and airpods I have pixel buds now and they just dont hit how I hoped  unfortunately Im one of the users affected by scroll stutter and lag in many apps like Reddit FB YouTube and instagram makes me feel like the phone is less premium On android 15 Google photos just isnt as seamless as iCloud photos imo it syncs inconsistently for me switching between cameras is VERY choppy  app performance I feel as if the QAQC of 3rd party apps is not up to par with apple the difference between optimization of different apps is noticeable whereas on iOS they are all generally similar to where you dont feel much of a difference ","180":"iOS vs PixelAndroid my experience.So Ive been working on this for a few months and posted it a couple of times and got some helpful feedback and I think its finally ready to share This will be mostly an Apple vs Pixel comparison but for the most part goes for all Android phones For context I went from Pixel 4a  iPhone 13 Pro  Pixel 5 I used the iPhone for 5 months before throwing in the towel These are obviously not all of the differences but these are the ones that I found most impactful on my personal experienceIn order from most impactful to least Pros iOS is just way faster and more reliable Apps work so much better and faster on iOS and contain additional features that are simply missing from their Android counterparts Memory management is better apps seem to never ever have to relaunch Apple does more with less software is better optimized to make the most of the hardware It really does seem to just work for the most part What it does do it does consistently well and things behave the way you expect them to I havent encountered a single bug By far and away the biggest pro Definitely other people I know have experienced bugs but most people seem to agree with this on the whole My Pixel 4a had a number of issues The most significant of which was a proximity sensor issue presumably that would turn off the screen when I had an incoming call making it unable to answer and making me unable to access the buttons in the middle of a call And the fingerprint sensor did not work I had it replaced and it worked again for a few weeks and then stopped working again WiFi calling does not work on my Pixel 5 just silence and I had to disable the DNS because it was causing me to lose service altogether mobile and WiFi multiple timesday until I restarted it which was also really fun to diagnose iMessage Really only a benefit because other people I message have iPhones Android has an equivalent product but like many of their equivalent products they have failed to proliferate Perhaps a downside to the customization of Android is carriersOEMs fight over standardization which means nobody uses any of them Its fine but thanks to Apple it only works on Apple devices Support if you need help with an issue unless you pay extra for AppleCare Apple will direct you to their mostly useless online selfhelp resources but worstcase scenario you can just walk into an Apple store assuming you have one nearby and they wont  turn you away When I was looking for a new phone it felt like there were no Android OEMs that wanted to sell me a phone When I walked into the Apple store this is what ultimately sold me Their reps are super nice and eager to help Google has Preferred Care via uBreakiFix but its really not the same experience and there are no Google Stores to my knowledge Video quality is drastically better than anything available on Android thanks to the optics and A15 chip I dont think anyone will argue against that However its worth noting that the vast majority of the time when you share those videos the quality is just murdered to the point that it really doesnt matter Ecosystem If you DO have ALL Apple products they work together exceptionally well Android has some stopgap solutions with Windows but unless youre using a Chromebook which comes with its own compromises there is no powerful and versatile desktoplaptop solution There is no good tablet or watch currently There are options on the horizon but theyve tried this before and failed Connectivity I seemed to always have service interruptions and weird quirks and bugs with every Android phone The iPhone was exceptional in that regard and I had service in many places I did not with other phones Battery life Its a longboi Apples vertical integration allows for super powerful but also high efficiency hardware The battery will easily last me a couple of days Haptic Feedback yes its as good as everyone says its almost like a whole language and the ability to customize your own haptic feedback is pretty awesome Shortcuts I didnt really get around to using these but it is quite a neat feature but not super userfriendly The fact that theres a sort of store where you can simply install them is supercool and makes them more userfriendly Its pretty annoying that a notification pops up each time a Shortcut is run Android has some similar but inferior apps like Macrodroid and IFTTT but nothing baked into the OS Google has routines via Assistant but theyre incredibly limited in what they can do iPhones have 5 years of software support The latest Pixels get at least 3 years for OS updates and 5 years for security updates that may include feature drops Most Android phones are lucky to get 2 but Pixels have a good track record Hold that thought though until we get to the consCons Spam handling As someone who receives about 45 annoying spam textscalls per day they just make me miserable Firstly and Im not sure if this is particular to the Pixel or just the Google phone app but Google runs any incoming calls against their Google Maps database so it gives you a sort of quasicallerID whatever happened to caller ID anyway Secondly the Pixel has the Call Screen feature and a robust SMS spam filtering service not to mention Hold For Me and Direct My Call that works really well There are very few things I consider invaluable in a smartphone but Call Screen is one of them Theres nothing more satisfying than looking down at a silent notification and seeing that some spammer or robocall was screened and declined You dont even realize how well the SMS filter works until you go into the spam folder and look at all the messages it filteredor buy an iPhone iMessage hasalmost nothing You can filter unknown senderscallers and you can bring in other 3rd party callmessage filtering apps but they dont seem to work well and are typically a paid service When searching through Apple support they just direct you to talk to your carrier Blocking callers is like a 12step process and theres not even a way to mark them as junk This was the last straw for me and why I eventually threw in the towel I had a particularly bad day for spam Like 10 callstexts in the span of a few hours Huge 1 con for sure but thats just me Notification handling and customization On Android notifications are automatically sorted and grouped according to importance Some can be silenced The iOS notification pane again relies on the furthest possible corner of the phone if youre righthanded Persistent notifications are nonexistent and I find this means my notifications are regularly missed or forgotten about After a while I realized there are lock screen notifications and then there are MORE OTHER NOTIFICATIONS when you pull down the notification shade FUCKING WHY The swipe gestures are difficult to use Many times I try to do a horizontal halfswipe or whatever to get to the options menu to change notification settings but then swipe a little too far and it disappears from existence Theres no way to access notification history like you can very easily and intuitively on Android so theyre just gone forever Ive noticed many people pay no attention to their notifications as they have a thousand of them but I manage them very closely on Android to ensure the important stuff was prioritized The notifications on iOS dont disappear when I read them on another device specifically Gmail like they do on Android Keyboard The fact that after all these years Apple still does such a bad job with something so simple and something you interact with every time you pick up the device is nothing short of astonishing The Apple keyboard has a mindbendingly stupid buttonaccessed second layer for all punctuation and numericals GBoard on Android allows you to add a second longpress layer add a number row and resize the keyboard to maximize screen real estate Swipe typing on iOS justdoesnt seem to work very well at all Swipe typing on Android makes onehanded typing very easy I can even do it without looking The Android keyboard also has a dedicated button to dock it where on iOS I have a hard time figuring out how to put it away SOMETIMES you can swipe down and it disappears but other times it doesnt and its just very confusing and inconsistent The audible feedback on iOS is just this loud almost earshattering clack GBoard has a nice sound like rubbing your finger on a piece of paper It also has different sounds for the space and backspace buttons that legitimately make it easier to type faster and more accurately 3rd party keyboards make typing a little better but still much worse than GBoard Antirighttorepair stance Does it really do any good to have 5 years of software support if they dont support the hardware Apple is an industryleader in preventing repairs of their own devices and irreparable construction methods They go to great lengths to ensure this going so far as to serialize virtually every part like camera modules so they wont work even if you swap them from one iPhone to another They have also sent ICE to raid small businesses who are using OEM parts sold illegally from Chinese distributors and sent out cease and desist letters and threatened lawsuits The agreements with Apples vendors preclude them from selling any of their own parts to anyone but Apple That means if you have a broken 5 microchip you cant easily get it repaired anywhere and Apple will tell you you need to replace the entire device at a price that is not at all costeffective in an effort to get you to trash it and buy a new one Although they do provide costeffective solutions for common replacements like screens and batteries Custom notification sounds This is a huge one for me because I can tell the priority level of any notification without pulling the phone out of my pocket and whether or not I need to readrespond This helps tremendously for me to maintain focus on what Im doing Not possible on most iOS apps No universal back gesture This is something I used on Android every time I picked up the phone Its very intuitive and natural if you want to go back you just swipe from the edge of the screen iOS doesnt seem to have any sort of universal back function at all Sometimes you can swipe from the left of the screen to the right but it is inconsistent as to when you can do this Also even when it does work swiping left to right is not the easiest thing to do righthanded The Android gesture is ambidextrous Desktop messaging More walled garden problems In order to use a desktop client you must have an Apple computer On Android you can use whatever you want its just done through the browser So Im forced to type on and read from my tiny little phone screen when Im at home on that miserable little keyboard instead of my 49 desktop monitor and fullsize physical keyboard Text selection It boggles my mind that something so simple can be implemented so poorly and for so long I still dont understand how its supposed to work because it seems to do something different every time Longpressing on the screen brings up a magnified view which is promptly hidden by the finger youre using to select when moving up Moving this magnified view updown on the screen and enlarging it seems like a super obvious and simple fix to this issue It could even be tailored to right and lefthanded users but that type of customization is atypical of Apple You can also longpress on the space bar but the thing moves so damn fast that its incredibly difficult to get the cursor where you want it It seems the obvious and simple fix is just to slow it down I can send fucking memojis and Venmo payments but contacts cannot be sent from within iMessage I used this daily in Google Messages instead of typing out my name and title Instead I have to send through the contacts app which makes it not even worth the effort I just end up typing in my information on that miserable little keyboard I suspect this is another walled garden thing because it will send it automatically through iMessage if you opt into it Weight I guess some people equate a heavy phone with premium build quality Im of the opposite opinion Pixel 5 is 151g vs iPhone 13P 204g 35 lighter Keep in mind both of these devices are very close in external dimensions Most of this weight savings is derived from the more durable aluminum frame construction vs heavier more fragile premium glass No plugins for Firefox ad blockers dark mode etc All browsers are modified versions of Safari Face ID Face ID means you have a notch in the top of your screen which takes up the space used by persistent notifications in Android This is not an issue specifically with Apples implementation of Face ID but just the concept of Face ID in general If you ask me FaceID offers no benefits to account for this and they figured out biometric verification with the iPhone 5s fingerprint sensor Shortly after that many Android OEMs moved the sensor to the back of the phone to free up screen real estate its also just a more convenient location Anything and everything after that has just been an attempt at perceived progress while actually being the opposite in my opinion Default SMS If for example you wanted to use Signal on Android you can set it as the default messenger and it will just default to SMS if the person youre messaging is not using Signal Not possible on iOS Stupid fucking lightning cables Absolutely no reason for these things to have them but you have to spend another 100 on a whole set of new cables you have to carry around in addition to USBC cables for other devices for absolutely no reason Aesthetics Pixels and Google in general just feel very fun Very colorful and the Pixel UI reflects that with beautiful preloaded wallpapers that regularly rotate themselves out by default and Material You that gives you lots of fun colors and just generally being really nice to look at iOS on the contrary is fairly boring to look at and does not change on a regular basis much less in the last 5 years Slow charging 75W wireless 20W wired Bit of a nitpick here since theyre more efficient and have smaller batteries but many Android flagships are running 45200W charging My Pixel 5 is only 18W wired but 12W wireless with compatible charger obviously Not a huge issue either way for me personally as Im never far from a charger for very long Siri vs Google Assistant Google Assistant is still just so so much better Cost the iPhone 13 Pro I bought was 1k The Pixel 4a I had previously which is in my opinion superior was 350Conclusion The iPhone works better but the PixelAndroid does more I think thats the most succinct way I can put itApple really nails the difficult stuff like reliability efficiency ecosystem and speed but just flops on the easy stuff which is such a shame It would be very easy for them to make the iPhone 1000 better I will deal with the occasional bugs to achieve greater functionality","181":"Are Pixel and OnePlus the only real alternatives to Samsung Galaxy.Ive been in the Samsung Android ecosystem for some time but Im tired of Samsung Galaxy not having the ability to have more than one profile on a phone though theyre fine with doing that on their tabletsI want the ability to have a separate work and personal profile but thats just not possible on any Samsung Galaxy phoneI dont want to leave the Samsung ecosystem since I enjoy their products and I have a Samsung watch and ear buds but it really doesnt look like adding multiple profile options is something theyre going to doBut it seems that Samsung Galaxy seems to have the best camera for an Android phone so I think Im going to have to choose which one I want more Having a good camera is also fairly importantThat being said it really seems that my only options are either Pixel or OnePlus Any thoughts Especially from people who have used the latest models for Galaxy Pixel and OnePlus Or other Android phones I may not have consideredThanks","182":"Am I Crazy My pixel experience has been basically flawless imo.So I always hear so many people complaining the last few years on Reddit about issues with the pixel line However my p6 has always been fine other than maybe battery life Everything else has been relatively great I am impressed with the recent improvements with A14 though My battery life has greatly improved I have had this phone in the beta program since day 1 and its unlocked so no need for carrier updates Never had storage issues the finger print scanner did start off a little buggy but has improved and overall the apps work as intended Camera has been decent too Obviously its not the top of the line but if youre not a professional youre not gonna really tell the minor details Im just in love with unlocked phones and clean android I thinkMost people around me gave iPhones and they run out of space or their phones overheat more One time a coworker tried to update to a new iOS and it bricked their phone that was new enough to not have that issue I did buy an iPhone 12 mini off marketplace about a month ago to play with my last iPhone was the 4s honestly it was kind of bland to me I did like the stackable widgets and a few other little features but I did miss my pixel so the experiment didnt last long I tried to Google the iPhone as much as I could but it just didnt feel the same I know apple has a slightly better track record for privacy and refusing the feds access and all that but I just cant bring myself to buy into the apple ecosystem Im also the only employee at my company with an android so I get to test stuff out on our websites and apps which is fun Anyway I bought the p8 and Im excited for it Hopefully I dont miss the p6 size too much It just shipped a day earlier than estimatedETA I didnt expect this to blow up so thanks Im really excited for the p8 Curious to see how well the 7 years of full support goes as well I always used sub 300 androids prior to this so maybe thats why my complaining stays minimal Ha","183":"ExiOS users why did you switch to Pixel.For me its primarily the GSuite My first email is on gmail and so all my services are dependant on my Google mail ID Used iOS because it felt more mature than Samsungs cartoonish UI at least back in 2016era Tried Google Pixel 3 XL but traumatized due to the RAM management issues so switched completely to iOS and used iPhones for a WHILE I tried every Pixel from the 6series but returned due to lackluster performance Apples own apps legit felt like bloat on iOS because all I ever used was Google apps including Google Podcasts RIPBut now completely shifted into Google ecosystem with Pixel Watch 3 45mm and 9 Pro XL Loving it so far True bloatfree experience great cameras a bit slow but good and awesome Ui","184":"Pixel 9 Pro from an iPhone user.I would regard myself as a tech guy My phone plan allowed me to switch to a new phone as often as I want I have tried alot of android brands OnePlus Samsung Moto previous Pixel phones Each time I found myself switching back to the iPhone due to various reasons including app optimization camera quality audio quality software etc I just felt like iPhone was the most well rounded phone Having switched to the Pixel 9 Pro I genuinely feel like google hit the mark with this phone Camera quality is seriously amazing Friends and family will literally ask me to take pictures for them after seeing pictures Ive previously taken  Problems Ive had with previous generations of Pixel phones have been directly addressed including cell reception problems audio sounding tinny fingerprint scanner being slow  The AI features have been tossed around as gimmicky but I genuinely use them so much For instance Ive been wanting to try more foods so Ill literally ask Gemini to create me a spicy Indian dish with chicken and add all ingredients to my list along with instructions on how to cook and itll do it effortlessly Using the AI Live feature as job interview prep has been amazing Itll ask me questions and rate my responses I actually used Add me on a family trip this weekend and it worked effortlessly App optimization seems to have improved I use Snapchat and Instagram stories alot and the camera is great on there as well Although iphone is definitely better I feel like theres finally an established ecosystem The watch is much improved with the addition of a bigger size Ive had the buds 3 for about a week and theyve been nothing but great Although not directly related to Google RCS becoming more mainstream has made messaging iPhone users significantly better  If youre on the fence on switching  Id suggest on doing so I have a feeling youre worried about missing iMessage FaceTime and the camera quality But the new additions have not made me thing about this once  Ive had this phone for a month and have loved every bit  I actually went full send and purchased the watch as well as the buds Full ecosystem If you have any questions about the switch let me know ","185":"Pixel 6a Review from an Apple Sheep.First off I am basically the textbook definition of an Apple sheep I am completely bought into the walled garden with many of their products and services I upgrade my iPhone every year watch every launch event and talk about their superiority whenever the topic came up I never thought I would like or want to use an Android phone again after having multiple in years past Then came the Pixel 6aAfter starting my own business I realized I wanted a second phone to keep my personal life separate My iPhone would be the work phone since I used the camera and Apple specific apps constantly for my business Because I had the iPhone I didnt want or need anything super expensive for the personal phone Nothing extremely cheap as I am a tech person and definitely prefer more premium products but I didnt need to spend 1000 on something to text and run social media apps I originally started looking at the iPhone SE as it was cheaper and I would still be in the Apple ecosystem But after watching a few reviews on it people kept comparing it to the Pixel 6a which seemed better in many ways I always had a special interest in the Pixel series even as an Apple fanboy due to the cameras and stock Android One of my main complaints with every Android Ive had has been the bloatware After doing plenty of research I saw the 6a was on sale for 350 at Target and decided to pick one up to try it Much to my surprise I love it This thing is amazing for the price and I see its down to 300 now Total steal The things I like most about itStock AndroidThe stock Android on Pixels is miles better than any bloatwareridden Samsung phone I have ever used This phone is incredibly fast smooth and featurerich without a million random preinstalled apps I love the Material You customization and the Google assistant integration which is miles ahead of Siri The CameraWhile it does have the older Pixel camera setup and you can definitely tell in some conditions the camera on this little guy packs quite the punch Ive especially noticed this with closeup shots I did some macro comparisons with my 14PM and the Pixel was much clearer with better color The portrait mode is nice it has that artificial feel to it but so do the iPhones The astrophotography mode is fantastic and even the normal night mode does a good job Also the magic eraser feature is insanely good I showed it to a couple of my friends and they couldnt believe itThe HapticsWhile Im a big fan of Apples haptics I have to say I enjoy the hardhitting haptics of the Pixel The feedback you get while doing everything from typing to switching apps seems much more pronounced than the iPhone This could be due to it being such a smaller and lighter phone but the weight of this phone is a plus for me as well It feels like nothing in my hands compared to the brick that is the iPhoneOverall I guess when compared with my iPhone it shocks me that a phone this good can be priced this cheap Ive certainly enjoyed my experience with it over the past month and am already looking at the 7 Pro for that camera setup seeing how much I like the cameras on the 6a I will probably force myself to wait for at least the 7a if not the 8 though Pixel congratulations on turning an Apple sheep into someone that now has green bubbles","186":"iPhone User for 10 YearsThinking About Switching to a Google Pixel Thoughts.Hey everyoneIve been an iPhone

feels like Im getting the same phone with minor tweaks and Im ready for something new Ive been looking at the Google Pixel and it seems super interesting with its unique features like AI photo editing the call screening and of course the whole Android experienceHeres the thing Im trying to get realworld feedback from people whove made the switch If youve moved from an iPhone to a Pixel How has the experience been Do you miss iMessage or FaceTime Are the Pixel features enough to make up for leaving Apple Would you recommend switching or should I just stick with the iPhone since Im so used to

have been old ones they always have seemed to be quite responsive I played around with a few of the newer ones recently in store and liked the design and software What are some of the things you miss after switching What are some of the reasons you chose to switch One of my main concerns is I am a big privacy buff and I am not sure how privacy friendly a Pixel can be without some custom adjustmentsEDIT damn so many replies wow just adding this here which may change a lot of responses  I use 2 MacBook pros for work 2 jobs  and I will NOT compromise on that I just do not believe that any other laptop gets the job done as well and ages better than a MacBook I also have an Apple Watch Ultra 2 I wear 247 however I have considered replacing it with a whoop I am deeply in the ecosystem

there as most phone manufacturers can sell it as part of a 250400 phone Ive done some looking into this as part of a lower end camera and it doesnt look like the camera industry has caught up yet From

to 10 battery remainingWhat I took for granted when I left Android is just how well the Android OS works It has significantly better Platform APIs As a result the applications that are well built have incredible overall power Android has brought me significant work life balance The tight controls around work applications have allowed me to install Slack twice once for work and once for personal use

and I enjoy Pixel devices but this subreddit has so many negative posts about overheating battery life etc and it just becomes exhausting at some point Pixel devices are growing in popularity and there are many reasons for that The cameras the UI the software features the ecosystem integration etcetera are all reasons that I stay Im not even somebody that thinks Samsung devices have bloatware the S23 Ultra is a phenomenal phone and all of the apps that are construed as bloatware on here are generally easy to uninstall disable or hide without affecting performance whatsoever I just prefer the Pixel launcher over OneUI It looks cleaner more sleek and its a good middle ground between Samsung and AppleI know others have had similar posts in the past but some extra positivity never hurts in my opinionWhy do you stay with Pixel Have you had any significant issues with your Pixel devices Im genuinely curious to hear whyFor me I switched from an iPhone 11 to a Pixel 6 Pro and the UI just felt right to me the cameras were amazing and the phonecamera software tricks were genuinely beneficial to my day to day life The only issue I had was having to restart my phone once to get my phone paired to my sisters vehicle on a family road trip hardly anything to complain about Then I got the Pixel 7 Pro which has been just as good as the 6 Pro but more refined The camera colors are even more true to life and again I e only encountered one minor issue I brought it out kayaking with me one day this summer when it was about 90F and I was running the camera a lot after about 15 minutes it did say that it was running warm and camera quality may reduce while it cools down It wasnt ideal at the time but it wasnt a deal breaker for me and thats because the overall experience is so much better than what other phones have to offer me Ive got the Pixel Fold now and I genuinely have no complaints about it its a splendid device I guess app optimization from third parties could be improved but thats not Googles fault and Im seeing apps improve weekly so Im not too worried about that Alongside that I have immersed myself in the ecosystem I have Pixel Buds Pro and ASeries as well as a Pixel Watch My whole family has switched from iPhone and Motorola to Google and Samsung and I cant think of a single major complaintEveryone is going to have different experiences and if its not your flavor of phone thats fine My comment about using the phone incorrectly wasnt fair EditSo again why do you stick with Pixel","196":"Apple Ecosystem Dilemma  considering switching from iPhone 11

in with my Apple IdApple Services I use include Fitness iCloud Arcade Kiddo AirDropMost frequently used apps Spark Email client Apollo for Reddit Whatsapp Streaming AppsNow there is a great trade in offer available which effectively gets me a Google Pixel 6 Pro for 365 with some gift cards and stuff The trade in for iPhone 11 will be 500  200 bonus if you are buying the Pixel 6 Pro So effectively it is 700 for a 2 year old great condition iPhone 11If you are in my position and you have the money  will you buy the Pixel 6 Pro for that priceGetting the 6 Pro and reselling it for a 13 Pro is a bit complicated as I have to find a buyer might still loose value on a new 6 Pro and will have to shell out another 500  700 for the iPhone 13 Pro So if I get the 6 Pro Ill have to use itI have been watching reviews of the 6 Pro vs 13 Pro and they both are fantastic phones with great cameras Being a photographer myself I think I would enjoy bothAnd there comes the ecosystem This will effectively make my Apple Watch useless for notifications from the phone even though in theory I can use it Fitness is something I like and it needs the watch to function properly Mostly I watch the workout videos on the phone I edit my photos from my Mirrorless on the Mac Mini and Airdrops them to the iPhone for sharing which is seamlessI read about some guy using his Apple Watch with his Wifes iPhone using the family watch set up option albeit with all the less functional stuff no phoneelevated hrfall detection notifications etc In theory it is possible but I would be interested to know if adding an iPad to this mix can make things easier Since I could use the iPad and Watch for Fitness workoutsSo as far as I see the main cons of this switch are the Fitness usage and the Airdrop Do you have any suggestions to get around theseThe Pros  newer flagship device better cameras than iPhone 11 dirt cheap price for a flagship 365 if I choose to go aheadThanks for your time and suggestions","197":"iPhone X to Pixel 2 XL how do I make the switch Kinda stuck in Apples Ecosystem but want to switch.Hey everyoneIve been an iOS user since the iPhone 3G came out Only briefly owned an Android Smartphone the LG G2 which I loved hardware wise back then but hated software wise Thats why I switched back to iOS again Currently I have an iPhone X that I am giving my gf as soon as her contract runs out in June Ive lurked on this subreddit as well as the galaxy s8 and oneplus ones and it seems to me that none of the Smartphones are as perfect and running smooth as Google PixelSoftware is definitely more important to me than hardware so I assume the Pixel 2 is definitely the way to go I have a few questions beeing a longterm iOS user on how to make the switch the easiest 1\tWhat I really love about Apples backup approach is the iCloud and really enjoy the care free backups overnight Does google offer something similar When I read about it briefly I couldnt figure out if Google only backups via Google Sync or if it also has a dedicated Google Drive Backup solution for everything I also read that backing up Messages is only granted for messages up to 25mb I already use Google Photos Contacts Chrome and basically all the G Apps available on iOS so that doesnt worry me 2\tHow easy is it to switch all the content on my iPhone to the Google Pixel 2  Are there any hiccups or common things known not to work3\tWill the OLED display on the Pixel 2 XL really be way worse than my current iPhone X with no problems at all or is it still a hit and miss thing Ive heard some people and some youtubers say that Google improved their quality control in decemberjanuary and that most newer Pixel 2 XL dont have a bad screen anymore 4\tWhat is a good Smartwatch for the Google Pixel I am currently using an Apple Watch 2nd Generation and love the Health tracking 5\t which leads me to my next question How good is Googles Health equivalent compared to Apple Health 6\tI am using a Macbook and if I wanted to backup my iPhone on it I just plug it into iTunes and let it do its thing Is there a equivalent for that on macOs for the Pixel phone7\tLast question As I said the reason why I switched back to iOS is because the software and everything tied together works so smooth and I dont have to worry about security updates or OS updates in general Now the only reason why I wouldnt get a Pixel 2 XL is just because of the screen thats why I lurked at the One Plus subreddit but the hate and the problems they got over there is a whole nother story Did someone sucessfully custom romd a non Pixel Android Smartphone to a smooth level like the Pixel 2 XL here or played with the ideaThank you all very much for your time","198":"Are you happy with pixel.Hey guys This is is my first time posting here The reason is simple I have been watching a lot of pixel setup videos and I am very much leaned towards the UI which looks appealing And I heard lot of things about pixel phones that they dont have good battery or they get slow after one year and heating and other issues I have an iPhone 13 and I have been using it since 2022 and it works flawlessly never seen a lag but it gets warm when I play games So I wanna ask you guys if theres anyone who switched from iPhone to pixel Did you guys stay with pixel or are you happy and what did you do with your ecosystem part And does pixels stay strong after 2 3 years ","199":"Google Ecosystem on iPhone  Switch from Pixel.I am thinking of moving from Pixel 3 to iPhone 12 for my personal phone However Im very deep into the Google ecosystem and am wondering if the cost of ecosystem lockin is worth the advantages of an iOS switch For a few years Ive used a personal NexusPixel phone all the way from Nexus S through Pixel 3 and a corporateworkonly iPhone all the way from iPhone 5 through iPhone X and iPhone SE 2020 With the iOS 14 announcement and Googles lackluster Pixel 4a5 direction Im finally strongly considering conceding to Tim Apple But the depth of my dependence on the Google ecosystem gives me some pauseHas anyone else dealt with these issues1 Google Assistant I own a couple of Google home automation devices have smart lightinghome control etc So I end up saying Ok Google quite a lot How easy is it to access Google Assistant on an iPhone Can I set things up so that the iPhone is always listening for Hey Google instead of Hey Siri2 Google Photos I can pony up the 10mo for 1TB storage in Google Photos Is it wellintegrated on iOS Will syncing happen automatically on WiFi or does it have to be manually triggered Is all EXIF data including location completely stored Does fullquality actually mean no quality reduction and can I get JPGH264H265 going to Google photos instead of HEICHEVC3 Default Apps I know browser  email can be defaulted now I have a few more common workflows that involved external defaults though Can I send files from my Dropbox through gmail Can I click on a Zoom meeting link in Slack and automatically open the Zoom app Can I open an Instagram link in Facebook messenger and automatically open the Instagram app4 Texting from web Google has Messages for Web and Apple has iMessage Am I out of luck trying to iMessage from PC Or text message for that matter5 Somewhat tangential Lightning port Its so userhostile iPhone owners do you just keep that singular lightning cable around for your phone and USBC for everything else6 GBoard vs iOS Keyboard Ive seen    in place of an expletive from my iPhoneusing friends more often than I can count Is the iOS keyboard really a step back in terms of spellcheck and usability Does the emoji search work wellAnd Im weighing those inconveniences against the following iPhone perks1 Seamless Bluetooth  After using AirPods with my work iPhone Bluetooth feels primitive on Android2 Less choice Im past the phase of my life where I care about customizing my phones software I think IOS defaults launcher gestures themes are more minimal and cohesive than Android ones3 Video capture Better on iPhone plain and simple For the 50 of the time I want my pictures to move Pixel stabilizationEIS

on to the 4s 6s 7 Plus 8 Plus 11 Pro Max 12 Pro 13 Pro Max and now Im using the 14 Pro Max This years iPhones were super underwhelming and Ive always wondered what the other side was like My family is also only iPhone users so what am I going to miss from the iPhone ecosystem and how do I get around not having facetime or iMessage without making my family get new apps just to accommodate me Overall Im excited to switch Id just like feedback from anyone who made the switch","201":"Moving from a Pixel 2XL to a galaxy S21 Ultra.Addressed to fellow pixel 2XL owners Since the P2XL updates stopped Ive been scouting the market for a possible substituteThe new pixels were excluded from the beginning P5 because of the sound very important for me P4a for the small size and the 4G for the price too high for a virtually identical experience to my P2XL Ive decided to get the new S21 Ultra as a result of not finding much else in terms of new flagships really wanting to try a different ecosystem from Google Im growing increasingly annoyed with and above all a bloody good deal for trading in my old pixel Having used Google phones since 2013 I was a tiny bit apprehensive to put it mildly about the switch Now that Ive had the phone for a week I thought that my first impressions might be useful to those who are looking for an alternative to their P2XLIm not going to give a detailed comparison or review happy to answer questions I just want to address my biggest fears in switching to a Samsung device Ok Lets get this out of the way The camera One of my biggest fearsThe S21 is good Really good Portrait mode is the only setting I see my old pixel performing clearly better But the S21 is producing nice photos tooThe S21 is coming out on top virtually in any other setting Ive triedThe video comparison is embarrassing for the pixel But we knew this already One UIIve set up my phone as close as possible to my old one Same Google apps same default same widgetsBasically a cloneBut then Ive discovered Bixby routinesOMG What a featureI leave my house and automatically my WiFi turn off NFC on and more I jump into the car and Spotify opens I get to work and AOD and silent come on And Ive just started exploring it I think the more I accept ONE UI for what it is and the less I try to force it to work as a pixel clone and the more I appreciate itJust one example The app drawer Ive tried half an hour to get the drawer scrollable as in the Pixel Once accepting my failure Ive decided to organise it by most used app the most used on the first page and so onAfter doing that Ive realised that its not a bad system actuallyIts super customisable too wait to see Good Lock And while on the subjectAdsNo idea what people are complaining about I dont mean theyre lying I really dont see ads on my phone Just make sure to answer no to when at set up the system prompts you to accept tailored recommendations or whatever they call it Sound and displayStunning Not much else to sayThe options with the sound adjustments and Equalizer are greatNo problems with the accidental touchs eitherPunch hole funny enough one of my greatest fears 99 of times I dont even know its there SizeSame width No changes in holding the phone A bit taller but you can swipe down for the notification menu from anywhere on the home screen NegativesFace unlock is crap But fingerprint is good pixel was better and easier to find at the back thoughDesign Everyone is praising the look of the new Samsung Its good I agree The Phantom Black is just blackBut How can we compare it to the old panda The P2 is just such a nice design This is just a first impression Im sure Ill discover more negatives and positives with time TLDRHappy with the change Many fears turned out to be unjustified letting go of old habits can be challenging but ultimately rewardingIt feels like an upgrade but just definitely not at full priceA testimony to how ahead of its time the P2XL was","202":"Switch from iPhone 15 pro to Google pixel

easy to use and gives me notifications Im probably easier to please when it comes to features than most people It did the job just fine imoIt died recently the screen just wont turn on I decide to look at my options and it honestly feels like the same exact things are on the marketand theyre all mediocre I cant stomach spending another 150 to buy the same exact watch that barely lasted 2 years Its 200 for the Galaxy Watch Active 2 but even then200 bucks doesnt seem worth it for something that I really just mean to buy as a stopgap before I buy the unicorn Pixel watch Fitbits offerings are

Pixel 4 XL  my thoughts first Android phone.Hi guys Ive just got my new P4XL Ive come over from Apple  iOS and thought some people might be interested in how switching over went and how Ive been getting on with the phone A bit of background  Ive had iPhones since launch from OG until 8 and never really gave Android a shot  sure had a mess around with it on some relatives phones but felt like it was unfinished a lot of the time Over recent years the gap between the UX on iOS and Android had significantly reduced to the point where a lot were saying that Android software is superior now which got me researching About this time last year I started seriously thinking about getting either a Pixel or one of the Samsung phones especially since I found myself edging a lot towards Google tech in general also have a Chromecast and a Home and here we are Ill detail my experience so far below First and foremost I must say Im actually gobsmacked with how clean everything looks and feels in Android 10  its come a long way in my opinion as a person who has always been on the outskirts of Android software I know customisation has always been a perk on Android but Im actually blown away with how much more freedom you seem to have in how you want your phone set up In the Apple ecosystem it actually feels like you must do everything in Apples way and thats that Im actually already in love with Android OS some of the complaints I had early days resonated with how non integrated everything was but it feels like the balance is perfect whilst on iOS it still feels like its Apples way or the highway Simple things like setting a custom default video player better integration with things like my Chromecast and Home devices has honestly been a godsent Overall I think Ive fully been won over on the OS aspect I feel like Ill discover a lot more over the next few weeks tinkering my Android experience to exactly how I like it Im seriously enjoying this aspect of everything Also notifications on Android seriously blow iOSs out of the water  Secondly this is my first OLED screen phone too and with the 90hz refresh rate its been truly wonderful The phone itself feels supreme to hold and the camera is fantastic I can see huge potential in Soli too once Google gets more data I think it can end up being a really useful feature especially in cars or maybe when youre in the kitchen cooking Im actually surprised at how negative people have been towards this phone its easily one of the best on the market Genuinely have no complaints so far Also the data transfer from phone to phone was pretty seamless and easy Battery personally hasnt been an issue for me at all  I do have the XL version though I dont miss my iPhone one bit TLDR  Android  iOS P4XL feels like a supreme phoneAny questions let me know","206":"Google pixel 9 pro XL as main phone but in apple ecosystem.So my my whole family is heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem and all my friends and family have

that the case My other big worry is that the pixel is bad for PWM sensitive people because of the low Hz however I read that LTPO screens might be cause some of the issues and from doing basic googling it seems like the oleds are not LTPO on the Fold anyone who is PWM sensitive here that can tolerate the screensAlso is the fold thing a gimmick Am I just intrigued because of the novelty or

This Stock Android Fanboy is Almost Ready to Ditch the iPhone Forever Almost.Hey Reddit fam I gotta confess something I was an iPhone holdout Diehard Every year the Pixel lineup piqued my interest but

responsiveness are unreal Im talking buttery animations zero lag and multitasking that feels like magic Its a far cry from the occasional stutters and hiccups I experienced on my iPhone Plus the customization options are a gamechanger Themes widgets launcher freedom  its like finally having a phone that truly feels mineAnd then theres the Pixelexclusive magic Features like Magic Eraser and Call Screen are just mindblowing The camera with its unmatched computational photography is another level Every shot feels like a masterpiece and Googles constant updates and improvements keep it ahead of the curveBut heres the thing If Google hadnt nailed the stock Android experience on the Pixel 8 Pro I wouldnt be here Ive tried other Android phones and their custom skins often feel bloated and cluttered Pixel OS just feels right Its clean intuitive and perfectly optimized for the hardwareSo am I completely abandoning the iPhone forever Almost The only thing holding me back is the

RCS Messaging getting incorporated to iMessage I feel that is going to give a lot of people the freedom to venture out and try other phones I dont see Google pulling the plug on the Pixel lineup

great device and there are reasons why people love it My issue isnt with the device itself but with Apple as a company and the culture theyve created I dislike Apples arrogance and greed which is why Ive decided to avoid their products from now on The iPhone is wellrounded but quite boringI then switched back to Android opting for the S24 Ultra While the hardware is excellent the software is disappointing The camera performance is subpar especially for moving objects  and surprisingly the battery life didnt meet my expectations I couldnt tolerate the inconsistency across the device and the constant clash between Samsung and Google ecosystemsFinally I returned to my first love  Pixel I owned every Nexus device years ago and Google phones always had something special about them Although the magic isnt as strong as it once was the Pixel is arguably the best allaround Android device Despite not having the latest and greatest hardware and some occasional bugs it works well overall takes great pictures and maintains consistency across the deviceIf you have similar priorities to mine dont waste time and money buying and selling different phones Go for the Pixel and stick with it You wont find anything better The hardware is sufficient even with the Exynosbased Tensor chip The only area that really needs improvement is connectivity Its not bad but it could be better

Android itch started hitting me again When I switched to iPhone I was coming off that era of flashing and rooting so I wanted stability over everything iPhone certainly provided that and during that time I also got in deep with the Apple ecosystem Fast forward to 2022 I was in NYC and visited a Google store The Pixel 6A was on sale for cheap so I decided to grab one It was pretty good but at that time I was still sorely attached to iOS so I returned it There were key features in iOS that were still just too important to me like Car Play and Apple Card the latter of which Ive stopped using recently This is where my stubborness comes fromThings started changing this year though with iOS 17 out in the wild I felt like things were starting to feel really old to me Im now gonna talk about how Pixel fixes many of these issues for me1 Overall interface fluidness  when people say iOS is smooth theyre not wrong But using it long enough you realize how SLOW everything is in reality Things load but theres a delay before you can actually interact with them Android never had that problem but with this 90hz display and with how much the UI has improved this is one area that Im thoroughly enjoying2 Gboard  cant begin to express how much I missed it I had simply forgotten how good it was Autocorrect works well gesture typing is better and has more useful features and the GIF search actually nails what Im looking for every time iOSs keyboard was always too aggressive to correct things when I didnt want it to which is a problem I also face on Mac constantly 3 Notifications  do I even need to go into detail here iOS is a mess in this regard I still feel like making the lock screen view and the notification center be the same thing was a mistake when it was first implemented in iOS 11 Whats worse is theyve kept changing how notifications work over the years so just when you became used to interacting with them a certain way they change it Androids implementation is still as good as the day I left it 4 The look of the UI  I used to be a sucker for iOSs translucencyobsessed design but it was wearing off on me Material You rocks 5 THE FREEDOM  youre telling me I can patch Reddit Sync and still use it Say no more Android very obviously trumps iOS in this area Now some things that Im having sort of a hard time with that iOS really did well1 Android Auto  the big problems I had with AA back in 2018 when I owned a Galaxy were the poor audio quality and the battery drain iOS is superior in both of those areas especially with charging Every single iPhone Ive owned always charged comfortably while every Android phone Ive owned doesnt Ive decided to get a Moto MA1 and an Anker fast charger to remedy that but it sucks that I have to invest in separate gear just to have my phone not lose battery while using it in my car 2 Passwords  Google password manager just doesnt work me I easily exported all my Keychain passwords to a CSV file but the page to import them never opens I managed to do it on Chrome desktop through the browsers settings but for some reason they just never synced The password manager import page on the Pixel itself also does not work Quite disappointing 3 Apps  some very specific apps namely my local bank still has a very outdated interface on Android while the iOS version recently got a major refresh Otherwise most of the apps that I use have pretty good parity Overall Im loving my Pixel so far Its just what I wanted at the moment Feel free to ask any questions Im down to discuss my experience in transitioning after so

and The Ugly.I feel like Im gonna be roasted but here are my first impressions after the first day with the Pixel Watch 2 These are personal and preliminary opinions Im no MKBHD so take them with a grain of salt  The Good The dome design makes the watch more vulnerable to scratches but it looks amazing I love some of the new watch faces They fit the watch design nicely Haptic feedback is heaps ahead of my Samsung 4 The new redesigned Fitbit app looks great both on the phone and on the watch Its great to have the whole Google App ecosystem available rightaway Google Home Google Assitant Google Wallet Calendar etc The watch is super comfortable to watch The watch feels super snappy The Bad One thing that I couldnt figure out is how to start a workout session and keep the media controls visible On my Samsung Watch I would use that all the time to skip a song Am I missing something In contrast to the nice haptic feedback the rotation crown feels a bit cheap to me I would prefer to trigger Google Assistant using the crown as the other button is a bit hard to reach The Ugly I have to start with the lack of a bigger size After reading so many reviewers complaining about the size I had pretty low expectations and still I was left disappointed If youre taller than 58 I would recommend you to try the watch before buying it Smaller watches might be your cup of tea but I imagine a lot of people will find the watch too small to their taste When running I like to take a sneak peek at the watch to see the figures The watch is so small that I have to stop in order to read the screen I went for a 45minute run and it drained 20 of the watchs battery I know its a bit early to make a call but the first impression is not great SummaryGoogle is on the right track with the watch There are lots of thing to like about the watch and if you like smaller watches this will be the ideal option for youIm gonna give it a couple more days to see if I can get used to the size but the likelihood is that I either return it or give it to my niece as a gift yes Im a great unclePlease dont take the feedback as negative Just sharing my opining and hoping it can help other people who are looking to buy one Its always good to have different opinions Keep it civil please","232":"I am about to switch to the pixel 6a coming from my iphone.does anyone have any tips on moving to pixel I

everyoneIve been thinking about this switch for days now watching videos reading posts and honestly the idea just wont leave me alone Im currently using an iPhone 14 Pro Max and am pretty deep into the Apple ecosystem with an iPad MacBook Apple Watch and AirPods But the more I think about it the more I feel like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold might be a better fit for my needsWhen I look at my actual use the only Apple ecosystem features I regularly use are the notifications on my Apple Watch and occasionally copypaste between my iPhone and Mac And Apples recent announcements didnt exactly wow me  the iPhone 16 Pros new camera button for example feels completely irrelevant for me and just makes me feel more like Apples updates are missing the mark for my use caseIve always been a fan of big screens and the Pixel 9 Pro Folds large foldable display and advanced AI features really appeal to me Since I work in IT I think the extra screen space and flexibility could be major advantages in my everyday workflowOne hesitation I have comes from my past experience with Android where it seemed like over time the system would slow down and become frustrating to use But I assume this issue is probably a thing of the past by nowI know that in benchmarks the Pixels performance isnt as high as Apples latest but Im curious if thats something youd actually notice in daily use as a regular user Plus Id still have my old iPhone on hand for anything I need thats Applespecific so I feel like theres less risk in giving it a shotFor anyone whos made a similar switch or is considering it whats been your experience with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold especially for daytoday tasks Do the software and AI make up for any performance differences And is there anything you actually miss from the iPhoneThanks for any insights  I really appreciate the input","235":"Thinking of leaving Apple for a Pixel Fold.I wanna start by saying I LOVE technology I remember back in high school I purchased the moto 360 watch when I first came out and everyone made fun of me for having a computer on my wrist Then when I went off to college I purchased the first Lenovo Yoga that folded even though it was way over priced just cause I loved the cool tech in it Over the years Ive been an android fan and never owned an iPhone I went from Nexus to Samsung to Pixel to One Plus back to Pixel back to Samsung Fast forward to a few years ago I met my wife and she had an iPhone and I told myself that since I havent tried an iPhone yet Id grab the next good one that came out That was the iPhone 14 Pro last year Since then Ive spent a couple months getting deep into the Apple Ecosystem HomePods iPad MacBook HomeKit Smarthome Apple Watch Apple TV heck even the Apple Card Everything works beautifully together its kind of crazy actually It really is a Walled Garden But after a year in it Im missing something My scratch for new tech isnt being itched I could get an M3 MacBook or the new Apple Watch Ultra 2 when they come out but they dont really excite me What does is the Pixel Fold Pixels have always been my favorite phones over the years and a folding one looks sweet Even though its overpriced and has shortcomings the pure tech in it makes it desirable to me Plus the benefit of leaving the Apple Ecosystem The freedom to switch phones or headphones or watches and not feel like Im using an inferior product just because it isnt the same brand That freedom is way better than waiting for the slightly better Apple Watch 9 or IPhone 15 every SeptemberNow the question which color Fold should I get","236":"Ive ordered iPhone air pods ipad and pixel 6a on Flipkart All delivered on time Dont loose hope.nan","237":"Ive used every Pixel phone Here are my thoughts on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro after months of use.Hey guysPixel phones have been some of my favourite phones over the past years Ive had the privilege to own every Pixel flagship thats come out While the Pixel 5 was a really good phone overall I wished for a more premium phone from Google as it missed some key features like the zoom camera better haptic motor and speakers When Google announced the Pixel 6 lineup I was cautiously optimistic On paper the phones seemed to be the best Pixels ever So I went ahead and got both the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro Here are my thoughts on the phones after using them for about 5 monthsDesign and Build QualityI think Google got a lot right with the design and build quality of the phones Both phones feel premium in hand While it was great to have a metal back in the Pixel 5 the plastic coating made it feel like a budget phone last year I also like that we got to have more colour options this yearWhile Google got a lot right this year they werent able to hit a home run on everything Both phones are quite big and somewhat heavy I wish Google created a smaller model as using the phones with one hand is quite challenging Im also not the biggest fan of the glossy back I think the frosted white from the Pixel 4XL was the best feeling material Google had and I wish they did something similar this time aroundOn the bright side Google used a much higher quality haptic motor this time Both phones have some of the best haptics on Android devices Also the speakers are way better this year The sound quality is pretty nice and I had no issues with calls or playing media during my time with the phonesPerformance and Battery LifePixel phones are known for their buttery smooth performance and clean UI Even the Pixel 5 was able to be incredibly smooth with midrange specs So it was not surprising to see the Pixel 6 perform like a true flagship Everything is buttery smooth here and I noticed some processor intensive tasks to be a lot faster on the Pixel 6 vs the Pixel 5 For example apps install much quicker on the Pixel 6 compared to the Pixel 5I dont game on my phones but for everything I used the phones for the Pixels delivered some of the fastest Android experience Ive hadBattery life has been pretty decent in my experience Both phones easily got me through an entire day I found the Pixel 6 battery to be slightly better than the Pro This could be due to the difference in antennas Both phones would typically have over 30 by the end of the day While this isnt as good as the iPhone 13 Pro as I typically have around 4050 battery left by the end of the day Im pretty comfortable with the Pixel 6s longevity throughout the dayScreen and Fingerprint SensorThe Pixel 6 has a 90hz flat screen and the Pixel 6 Pro has a 120hz curved screen To be honest both feel just as smooth Its very hard to tell the difference between 90hz and 120hz But compared to 60hz both phones feel incredibly smooth Also both screens get bright enough for easy day time viewing so no concerns thereI personally prefer the flat screen of the Pixel 6 The curved screen while it looks more premium doesnt offer the same user experience as the corners are desaturated and there are some accidental touches here and thereThe fingerprint sensor on the phone is absolute trash This is one of the worst fingerprint sensors Ive ever used It has gotten better with updates but it still misses like 50 of the time when my hands are very dry Its particularly bad outdoors for some reason Ive tried scanning my fingers multiple times but that still doesnt fix the issue This is almost a dealbreaker as this is one of the only biometric unlock methods and Google doesnt offer face unlock I really miss the rear fingerprint sensor from the Pixel 5 Software ExperienceI have mixed feelings about the software Performance wise the phone absolutely flies and offers some of the best Android experience Even comparing to new flagships like the S22 Ultra I feel the Pixel is smoother in daytoday use However I feel Google is taking a step back with Android 12 While it looks prettier than older releases usability has gotten worse For example theres no more wifi toggle You have to go to internet and then change your wifi You cant get rid of the at a glance widget on the home screen which I dont understand The only way you can have a clean home screen is through a third party launcher but then the animations arent as smooth when youre multitasking unless you root the phone Also not sure if this is a widespread issue but I found notifications on the Pixel 6 to be slower than the iPhone 13 Emails notifications in particular took a minute or two longer than iPhones to show upOn the other hand theres a lot of stuff to love Google is offering 5 years of security updates which is way better than most Android phone makers Call screening is still one of my favourite features and I wish more phones had something like this I also really like the new widgets you get with Android 12 They really add to the fun vibe Google is trying to create with Android 12Also Pixel 6 has some of the best voice recognition Ive experienced with a phone The phone instantly recognizes everything I say It really makes you feel like youre living in the futureI hope Google starts to offer a mode similar to Dex on the Pixels As phones get more powerful itll be great to expand the ways we use our phonesCameraI have mixed feelings here as well Google was the king of smartphone photography for at least 3 years and it was one of the main reasons I used Pixel as my daily driver This is also the reason I started ShotbyPixelhttpsinstagramcomshotbypixel years ago This year I was very excited about the cameras as Google finally changed the sensors and offered more than 2 cameras On paper Google was set to be the camera champ once again but reality ended up being quite differentThe ultra wide angle camera isnt wide enough The quality is quite average and the shots I got werent as nice as the iPhone 13 Pro or Samsung S21S22 Ultra The main camera took stunning pictures most of the time but it also missed more than previous Pixels Also I feel Google went overboard with the processing Photos have a very digital overprocessed look to them at times which Im not a big fan of On the bright side the bigger sensor gets some nice shallow depth of field Its good for closeups but not great when taking photos of documents as the camera isnt able to focus on entire documentsThe selfie camera is also quite average I like that its wide but I wasnt a big fan of the end resultThe telephoto camera surprised me in a good way I love the shots that I was able to get from the camera The 4x telephoto really lets you frame photos in a way most phones donthttpswwwinstagramcompCXbn7dgl4nZ Also the short minimum focusing distance almost makes this a macro camera as well While I dont think most people should spend the extra money to get the Pro for the telephoto camera its worth the investment if you take a lot of photosFinal ThoughtsI think Google got a lot right this year with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro Both phones look and feel great and offer exceptional performance and software experience Plus the price of the regular 6 makes it very easy to recommend to most people who want an iPhone like experience on Android I hope Google continues to invest in the Pixel ecosystem The phone has a lot of potential but the lack of accessories such as a Pixel watch really work against it when compared to Samsung or Apple phones If Google is able to improve some of the software issues and fix the fingerprint sensor the next Pixel has a serious shot at being the best Android phone For now I think the Samsung S series still provide a better overall experience due to the ecosystem and features","238":"best way to transfer files from pc to pixel.just got a new pixel 9 pro after being on the apple ecosystem for a while whats the best way to do quick wireless file transfers between

back to AndroidWhat I like I like that the gesture support is almost on par with iOS since after using it quite extensively ayoko na bumalik sa normal 3 button setup ng Android Mas gusto ko na pwedeng swipe from the left or right to go back compared to iOS na swipe from left lang Na miss ko yung pag customize ng home screen its true na medyo customizable narin yung iOS pero 1 day ata ako nagspend

para sakin yung differences Ibang usapan yung videoWhat I dont like Font might be bias pero preferrence ko na yung SF Pro ng iOS dapat pwede tong palitan sa Android mukang kaya naman pero di na provided natively atleast nung android version na nasa pixel Mas maganda parin yung video capability ng iOS not just sa qualitystability pero yung pag capture ng audio cant remember the term pero mas naeemphasis na audio is kung saan naka tutok yung vinivideohan mo Wala nang long press sa messenger para hindi maseen hahaha although you get the bubble chat in exchangeNeutral comment but worth mentioning Apps font size consistency mostly developer issue pero di consistent yung font size per app using the setting app as a basis may mas malaki may mas maliit Face ID may provided face ID si pixel pero pag maliwanag lang gumagana which is dahil naman kulang sa sensor pero medyo eto yung something na you dont think about sa iOS then balik ka sa consciously pag fingerprint although now di naman na big deal Good bye iMessage with wifey medyo di daw siya sanay and nag wwhatsapp kami pero no big deal din naman Good bye Airdrop although more on problem nila since sila ang manghihingi ng

Android devices The move to bring its Gemini AI assistant to supported devices shows again how Google aims to put its AI in front of consumers before Apple which will launch its AI on iPhones Macs and iPads later this yearGoogle doesnt make a lot of money from its hardware business but the latest Android features could help drive new revenue through the companys Gemini AI subscription programWeve completely rebuilt the assistant experience with Gemini so you can speak to it naturally the way you would with another person said Android Ecosystem President Sameer Samat in a Tuesday blog post It can understand your intent follow your train of thought and complete complex tasksStarting today you can bring up Geminis overlay on top of the app youre using to ask questions about whats on your screen Samat wrote It will be available on hundreds of phone models from dozens of device makers according to GoogleGoogle previously had some AI features in Android but this is the first year its heavily emphasizing new capabilities powered by a large AI language model installed on devicesOne example the company provided involved a user uploading a photo of a concert list and asking Gemini to see if their calendar is free after which Gemini checks Google Calendar If the user has availability in their schedule Gemini offers to create a reminder to check ticket prices later that nightThe assistant can also perform tasks using information from Google appsFor example Gemini can help create a daily workout routine based on your personal trainers email or use your resume in Google Drive to write a work bio the company stated in its blog post The company also said a user might ask the Gemini assistant to draft an email and create an image of a cake for someone who loves space which the assistant can create and attach to the email Or in YouTube a user might ask Gemini a question about the content in a videoYou can ask about whats on your phone screen in other apps too like Maps Flights and Gmail Google said its working to add support for thirdparty extensions which suggests developers may be able to add the option to their apps laterGeminis assistant has a range of voices A user can have a humanlike conversation through its Gemini Live feature which the company first announced at its May developer conference Live will initially be available for select devices and

stands for random access memory an important part of a computers hardware that stores data needed to run applicationsRAM is a crucial component for running artificial intelligence inside a smartphone Google has said that the amount of memory is a major factor in determining whether a phone can run AIBy contrast only highend iPhones released in 2023 can run Apple Intelligence which AI developers

Pro.Hi everyone thank you for your help last week answering some questions I had as a somewhat technical person who has been in the Apple ecosystem for a decade but giving the Google Pixel 7 Pro a try  My technical summaryx200BHOLY  CRAPx200BI feel stupid for waiting this long  I originally decided to make the change as my car can allow me to use my phone as a key but only if its an Android w NFC  Some of the other functionality just SMALL things is blowing my mind  A few examples Smart enough to take care of OTPs itself deleting them after 24 hours  I get to avoid a thousand messages of old OTPs that I neglected to delete The phone to Windows PC is seamless  I did have a Macbook a while ago and it was nice to be able to address texts and calls from the laptop  Works just as well on Windows PC with the Android phone Forgot how much I missed fingerprint scanning  It doesnt work sometimes but I think its just how Im holding the phone and I can enter a few more fingerprint credentials in to help that  It works a lot better than some of the messages here suggested but I know there have been patches so perhaps thats part of it  In any event Im going to rack it up as a net positive As I mentioned Im fairly entrenched in the Apple ecosystem Apple HomePods family has iPhones and use Apple services etc  Happy to report it wasnt as painful as I expected  Apple Music works PERFECTLY on the Pixel and from the car  I just have to tell Google to shuffle the TheGrumpyGent playlist and it knows to crack open Apple Music and play away  While I cant directly control the HomePods they already know my account and voice so they play music fine and is pretty much all we use them for  Dumb for not thinking expecting it but HomeKit devices work just fine being added to Google Home at the same time  I can change thermostats turn onoff lights etc with no problemsx200BThere have been a few hiccups that are fine with me  minor annoyances listing them here not to complain but in case theres something obvious Im missing to fix them I ended up switching the whole family to use Google Calendar  On iPhone you can have the Apple Calendar app use a 3rd party calendar as primary and just turn off the iCloud one you just lose push updates they now get refreshed every 30 minutes  I couldnt figure out how to use an iCloud or a Microsoft Outlook calendar from the stock GCalendar app On that same topic I had similar issues with trying to use other Microsoft Office 365 services like OneDrive from the stock apps like Files  I ended up taking the plunge and upgrading my Google One subscription and moved my data over so instead of Microsoft invading my privacy its Google lol  Having said this the Gmailify service within Gmail is insanely good  It lets you link in another mail service and present email reply etc from Gmail but everything is handled and stored from your other account  Ill also say the features from the Google services like Photos are incredible as well but thats a separate discussion I think Im going to be SOL for now w regards to a smart watch  I really would rather keep to a single ecosystem and the Pixel Watch so far doesnt seem to be doing very well w battery  Id be replacing an Apple Watch Series 6 which is excellent I have to do a lot of travel for work and personal stuff its maddening that Google Calendar doesnt provide any means of getting alerts when its time to leave for a calendar event or to have the notification come to you 15 minutes before you have to leave due to traffic etc  Even Siri can do that The Google Pixel case is a bar of soap coated in vaseline  Zero grip whatsoever  I have a Spigen LiquidAir case arriving today heres hoping it has a bit more to it EDIT  One other annoyance is for my work apps MS Teams and Outlook  In order to use them you have to download Intune Company Portal  Initially pretty scary at first as its my phone not a company managed device however reading the documentation it appears what my company does see outside of the work apps is VERY minimal device name patch level of the phone my account and can manage the work apps in question  And I can appreciate needing that info for a BYOD and the apps w work data  Still was a bit jarring coming from Apple where that wasnt necessaryx200BAll in all Im blown away so far  Theres no comparison with Siri vs Google Assistant  The latter is truly a digital assistant that gets things done  A lot of my fears of switching over have been proven unfounded and I dont have devices around the house I cant use  And the device itself is pretty  It even fits in my front pocket still which was another concern  Thanks again everyone for the help last weekx200BOh and yes  Not having to carry around a bulky car keyfob is AWESOME","244":"1 month with Pixel 9 Pro XL coming from years of iphone .A little bit of background My wife has a windows surface pro laptop refuses to use a mac but loves her iphone and refuses to use android again after the Samsung S22 and pixel 4 years We got two little children baby and one 5 year oldI heavily used iphones still have an iphone 15 pro max 512gb but recently got a pixel and LOVE IT More than the iphone Ive used pixel 3 4 6 7s in the past and didnt like it for various reasons My apple ecosystem apple tv fitness plus arcade disney macbook pro 16 late 2024 model mac studio with studio display and apple keyboard largest ipad pro from 2021 with the magic keyboard thing 2TB icloud drive Still have my old mecomhttpmecom email Airpod 4 and airpod pro Apple watch ultra I still use all of these from time to time My apple watch is super useful for workouts I buy movies on apple since we have ipads for travelingWork ecosystem No apple products in USA government job Only use windows related hardware and software Google ecosystem 2TB cloud drive and gemini advanced pro that came with the pixel Youtube premium that comes with youtube music Pixel 9 pro XL Rolex Batman mechanical watch Google Fi cell service Chrome browser as its more compatible with many features on websites and the auto translate is awesome So why did I switch The pixel seems to be more advanced and do more things than the iphone even in prior pixel years The hardware SUCKED compared to iphones in the past Now the pixel hardware is superb and the softwareAI features are an awesome start for our world into AI In other words I got bored of the iphone and switched to pixel which makes me more excited to use daily Would I switch back to iphone full time use one day Sure maybe But for now I got the best of both worlds as my iphone as my secondary phone and my pixel as my main phone I cant connect my phones to work stuff because of work policies but its ok iMessage I mainly use whatsapp RCS helps but whatsapp is my main messaging service My whole family i mean ENTIRE family has iphones I am the only one that now uses android mainly I get asked did you get my imessage I smile and tell them nope I use whatsapp now on my pixel Especially while in Europe whatsapp is heavily used I use to care about the blue bubble and being included in family chats but not anymore Plus imessage only allows 10 people in a group whereas whatsapp allows over 1k in a single group chat not like ill have that many family members in a group chatIf pixel had some sort of premium workout program like the apple fitness stuff then id be all in probably with pixel watch and buds  Now if i posted this in the ios or iphone subreddit Ill surely get hateful responses "}}
