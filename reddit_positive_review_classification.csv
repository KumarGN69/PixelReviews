the ROG SWIFT PG32UCDM Currently ASUS is the only vendor to offer three 4K OLED PC monitors and the only PC monitor manufacturer to offer all panel types RGB OLED WOLED and QDOLED We would like to recap the primary features functions and specifications while also providing some additional FAQ type questions that we feel will be of benefit to the community and those interested in this monitor Earlier this year ASUS launched the first of its two highlyanticipated 32 4K OLED ultra high refresh rate gaming monitors with our QDOLED based PG32UCDM This monitor introduced ultrahigh refresh rates alongside the latest OLED panel tech These new panels critically also introduced improved text rendering and higher ppi alongside robust HDR support including Dolby Vision to important enhancements like TypeC connectivity with high wattage PD support SmartKVM and PiPPbP functionality as well as solid SDR and impressive HDR  performance All of this is housed in a monitor where critical items like heat polling and high temps can contribute to items like burn in ASUS address this through our ROG cooling design which includes a passive heatsink       The PG32UCDP features a WOLED panel  as opposed to a QDOLED panel  and features a dualmode refresh rate function that allows for gamers to switch between 4K at 240Hz or 1080p at 480Hz with a simple press of a button The UCDP also allows for impressive flexibility in customizing resolution and refresh rate via our customizable Aspect Ratio controls allowing for alternate display sizesresolutions and refresh rates to be utilized allowing you to find a sweet spot beyond these two default operating modes Like all ROG SWIFT displays it comes factory calibrated for great out of the box color performance and offers unclamped sRGB controls Due to the AR polarizer the PG32UCDP can be considered a better allaround monitor than the PG32UCDM although both monitors are exceptional in their own right      If this is your first OLED monitor some of the benefits you will see coming from an LCD will include   Outstanding pixel response  sub 1ms    Consistent pixel response throughout the refresh range  Superior motion clarity due to pixel response performance  SDR and HDR pixel response consistency  LCDs with HDR and FALD miniLED tech will experience an increase in blooming from SDR to HDR   Outstanding HDR performance due to superior contrast performance of OLED panel technology  Generally superior gradation performance and black reproduction  The PG32UCDP features a new minimal ID design similar to the PG32UCDM first introduced with our ROG SWIFT OLED PG27AQDM monitor It has thin bezels a slim tripod base that has been size and angle optimized ideal for angled placement of your keyboard and mouse It also features an integrated cable routing hole and a responsive and easy to access centrallylocated rearmounted joystick for OSD control You can also control the OSD directly in Windows via Display Widget Center software  The rear panel sides have a metal layer which adds a premium feel and benefit for a more secure feel in making tilt or swivel adjustments The housing also integrates intelligent pathways for airflow to complement the ROG cooling system which includes custom heatsinks passive alongside graphene film to keep power components and the panel operating at lower temperatures The passive design offer superior reliability and durability and means no possibility of fanbearing noise over time   Please see the key specifications below Primary specifications  Panel

displays such as burnin ASUS took this feedback very seriously when designing our new OLEDs and developed ASUS OLED Premium Care to address these concerns ASUS OLED Premium Care is a multipart solution  3rd Gen Panel improvements hardware firmware and software all complemented by additional after sales service and support Users still need to be mindful of how to use OLED inherent operating characteristics but the improvements to the 3rd Gen of QDOLED panels carefully designed and located heatsink alongside monitor specific firmware hardware and last but not least software support help to mitigate many of the factors that can lead to burnin Its easy to forget that newer versions of technology can address issues of its predecessors The 3rdGen OLED panel features improvements to improve durability lifespan and specifically make improvements relative to image retention Next heatsinks on the display are a product of ASUS leveraging our experience in testing and designing cooling assemblies for different products ASUS decided that the best user experience would be achieved without the use of fans To create a passively cooled monitor we designed a custom heatsink which is complemented by the use of graphene film behind the QDOLED panel Other small details were not overlooked such as placing vents on the monitors back cover to allow heat to naturally exhaust The monitor also features a human presence proximity sensor to assist in further protecting the monitor It will dim the screen reduce brightness when not being used  After an extended period the monitor will enter standby The UCDP like the UCDM also features an external AC adapter design to further reduce heat build upheat polling One of the most common points of AC adapter failure are surges spikes sags and brownouts Having the AC adapter external means the adapter can be replaced compared to being integrated into the monitor and requiring the entire monitor to be ship for

"positive"," The Pixel Watch 3, while offering good fitness tracking and battery life, lacks essential features such as music playback, photo storage, oxygen monitoring, stress measurement, accurate skin temperature readings, and real-time pulse detection in certain regions.

"positive"," Despite recurring complaints about performance and lackluster features, Google's Pixel phones, especially since the Pixel 7 Pro, consistently rank highly or win top awards in smartphone comparisons and camera competitions.","Pixel hype.So Ive noticed this trend every year since 2022 after a pixel launch All the YouTubers start making these comparison videos of the flagship pixel with a Samsung flagship of the same year And as always the Samsung flagships wins with a clean slate besides cameras making pixels look like a bad purchase Then 2 months after release around nov or dec some of the major YouTubers do this yearly smartphone awards where they award phones in different categories Somehow Pixel phones since 2022 so basically since pixel 7pro manages to win best flagshipandroid or smartphone of the year android or is at least a really close contender And not to mention about the camera awards that even a budget pixels wins sometimes Im usually in xcom or threads tech space and I see people constantly complaining about everything So Im wondering with all the complains that people have about how these phones are lackluster and doesnt have enough performance and or how Google is doomed how it still manages to be at least at the top even with the underperforming chip than vast majority of the smartphones I mean with the hype that the 9 series is getting I wouldnt be surprised if they would be the favourites"
"positive"," Despite its impressive video recording capabilities, the user finds the Pixel 9 Pro's Bluetooth connectivity disappointing and the phone's overall performance less refined compared to their previous iPhone, citing issues with frequent speech recognition errors, unreliable fingerprint unlock, and inflexible customization options.","A regular users thoughts after using the Pixel 9 Pro for two months.Background of the purchase I had been using an iPhone but since my childs kindergarten activities required a recording device I found it challenging to find a suitable DV It seems that major companies are now focusing on smart phone recording devices After some research I was drawn to the Pixel 9 Pro for its 5x zoom lens video boost feature and Gemini and I also wanted to try the latest Android system So I decided to go with the Pixel 9 ProImpressive features1 The zoom quality up to 15x is quite good and the Video Boost feature is stunning perfectly meeting my needs for recording my childs kindergarten activities2 Gemini is incredibly convenient quick inquiries and responses from the local LLM are very efficient and its voice recognition capability is excellent3 I can use apps to block spam calls and texts Finally 4 The display is detailed and vibrant and various apps run very smoothly5 Six months of free Google One Gemini Advance provides me with an additional LLM service option Sometimes the answers from gemini advance are better than GPT4o6 Adding events and performing other tasks with Gemini Advance is very convenientAreas for Improvement1 First the Bluetooth is very disappointing I enjoy using Bluetooth earbuds while doing chores but if I move more than 5 meters from the phone the sound starts breaking up In my opinion reliable Bluetooth connectivity is a basic requirement for a smartphone and Pixel didnt meet this standard which is really unfortunate2 As a regular user I cant see much difference between 12MP and 50MP photos Plus you cant take continuous shots at 50MP which is frustrating when I need to capture multiple moments quickly3 Photos and videos can only be cast to a TV via Chromecast not Miracast I have a Chromecast 4K device a 4K TV and WiFi 6 but casting 50MP photos or 4K videos still appears blurry4 The Recent Apps gesture swiping up from the bottom fails frequently I like to close unnecessary apps and while this gesture is similar to the iPhones it often seems like the Pixel is actively blocking me from accessing Recent Apps5 Geminis responses are often too wordy and I typically only need brief answers Using prompts to refine responses leads to longer voice interactions which increases the risk of speech recognition errors6 Fingerprint unlock occasionally fails7 I cant remove the Google search UI at the bottom and the screenshot and search buttons in Recent Apps are also permanent As a regular user I dont need frequent search access8 The power and volume buttons are on the same side which makes it easy to press the wrong one9 The news recommendations on the leftmost screen of the home page cant be customized for another feature such as frequently used app predictions I dont like these news recommendations and can only turn them off rather than replace them with something more useful10 Theres no feature showing recommended apps based on my current context or historical usage dataReiterating I am just an ordinary user who doesnt enjoy gaming and only looks at my phone screen for about 30 minutes a day while using Bluetooth headphones to listen to audio for around 2 hours The issues Ive encountered might be due to individual device quality or possibly my lack of understanding of the proper usage methods"
"positive"," The user, despite the Redmi Buds 6 Pro's advertised LDAC support, cannot find or access the feature in the Xiaomi app or device settings on their Pixel 7. They seek clarification about this issue and potential solutions.","Question LDAC on Redmi Buds 6 Pro  Pixel 7.Hello there  I got my Redmi Buds 6 Pro yesterday and Im loving them thus far I came from the Redmi Buds 4 Pro which I unfortunately lost I have one issue with the 6 Pros though  These earbuds are advertised to have LDAC and I have seen posts where people talk about LDAC in these and screenshots where LDAC is shown in settings and whatnot However while I had access to LDAC on my 4 Pros and my Pixel 7 I cannot find it anywhere on my new earbuds either in the Xiaomi App or the earbuds settings page on my connected devices list I have them updated to their latest version  Has anybody had an issue like that before Is it maybe on but for some reason it does not show anywhere Can you suggest any way I can verify what is going on  Cheers"
"positive"," After a year, the user finds the Google Pixel 7's design, display, and weight to be improvements over the Pixel 3, but misses the glossy top, front-facing speakers, and unique features of the Pixel 3 like the colored power button and Active Edge. The camera is good for everyday use, but not as standout as before. The fingerprint scanner could be faster and more reliable, and the phone tends to get hot when gaming. Battery life is satisfactory, but the auto-rotate feature is inconsistent. Overall, it's a solid phone with some missed features from the Pixel 3.","Pixel 7 after 1 year compared to 3.This might be a bit irrelevant since the 8 came out but Ive been using the Google Pixel 7 for exactly a year now and I want to compare it to my previous phone the Google Pixel 3 which is also in its 5 year anniversary I may or may not have gotten the Pixel 7 exactly 4 years after I got the Pixel 3 lol    Firstly the design is pretty good The camera row gives me Bender vibes It makes for a recognizable look but I miss the glossy top of the 3 Transferring my data was a breeze but thats to be expected The display and overall phone size was startling and the phone is pretty heavy with my case but I got used to it Sometimes I even use it to work out my arm  Theres just the bezel at the bottom of the screen thats bigger than the top one for some reason I have a screen protector so I dont want to even know how strong the Gorilla Glass is I did drop my 3 a couple times though and and it only ended up with one crack on one of the bottom corners so I would assume this ones stronger  The power button did fall out just around a week after I got this phone but I fixed it recently with the warranty so thats there    Display is great but it has this green tint when viewed from a weird angle I dont think my Pixel 3 had this But its not a problem at all 90 Hz refresh rate is apparently so smooth my friends pointed it out Maybe Ive just been used to it Couldnt care less about the notch or camera hole as long as I get more screen space Plus it makes for some creative wallpapers    Im not a camera person so this section will be brief The cameras are good enough to take pictures with zooms really far I dont know enough about cameras to really say Maybe theyre actually better than I think  The funny thing is the main reason I even got a new phone was because the single camera on the 3 randomly became blurry so its ironic I didnt write more on the camera When I get the chance to Ill try the other features like Cinematic Mode and the Photo Unblur    Im also not a audiophile so what I say might not be a complete review The audio quality is pretty okay but I do miss the front facing speakers on the 3 Yes I know theres a speaker at the top but its not that powerful I think its for when your phone isnt on speaker in a call I didnt even notice it was there until a couple days later Since phone cases will make a cutout of the bottom speakers its even easier to cover it with your fingers when watching a video or playing games I feel like theres never a quiet sound for media volume at least Even the lowest setting is kinda loud but thats okay I use  wireless earbuds Googles very own so Im kinda just nitpicking All in all no problem    With performance this is my first time using Google Tensor so I cant tell if the G2 is an upgrade from the original The phone is smooth and responsive but I do notice it gets really hot when playing games I hardly play games anymore so this isnt a problem and sometimes I cant even tell if the temperature is rising because of the case I use Sometimes Im not sure if its from my hands or from the phone itself Not gonna lie for a phone that has double the RAM of my previous I was expecting more processing power because sometimes when switching apps they refresh unexpectedly It mainly happens when opening the camera app camera app How taxing is it    Speaking of speed the fingerprint scanner is not as fast or smart as Id want it to be It sometimes doesnt recognize my thumb even when its laying flat on my screen If the 7 is this bad I dont want to imagine the 6 I heard some updates messed up the sensor but Im not so sure thats true If it is then subsequent updates should be able to fix it When the fingerprint reader doesnt work I switch to face unlock I think its more consistent than the fingerprint sensor but it seldom works in low light or when I take my glasses off so I find myself using the PIN I use Extend Unlock to limit the failed attempts and its a game changer I have it for when my phone is at home The fingerprint scanner is still important for authenticating important transactions though    I know people have problems with the battery but in my honest opinion its completely fine If I can end the day with 20 or more thats more than enough to rate the battery and I usually do Like seriously what are you guys doing on your phones But then again I usually charge it at night time After using it for a year there hasnt been a big dip in battery life Fast charging is fast enough Im using the cable that came with the phone and I havent gotten a wireless charger Whats the best one for Pixel 7 If anyone has one please let me know      Features  Extra dim is so handy because I honestly think this phone is too bright even at the darkest setting so its always toggled when I wake up I just wish you could schedule it like Night Light Autorotate is very inconsistent in its effectiveness even if the phone is in a 180 angle I feel like tilting to the left side works more than tilting to the right side Ive noticed when I turn it on it says facebased Is that the reason its so unreliable As I mentioned in the camera section I havent tried it but can Photo Unblur really work on older pics Thats really cool Battery Share is cool too but its hard to stabilize both phones    Versus Pixel 3  In comparison I honestly feel the colors were more colorful on the Pixel 3 Its a bummer that theres no SD card slot but Im basically used to it Besides you get Google One for 3 months after you get this phone The default storage space is enough for me anyway The fingerprint sensor Was way more convenient on the back and could be used for bringing down the notification shade Definitely the biggest loss Cool little details of the Pixel 3 like the colored power button Active Edge and the twotone design are missing on the 7 Even the box package was way more interesting with stickers and stuff      And thats my experience with the Google Pixel 7 Its a pretty long read but I wanted to cover all my bases I didnt talk about software because most of it isnt unique to the Pixel 7 The features section is more or less about software anyway Overall its a good phone that Ive enjoyed but it lost some of the cool features that made the Pixel line stand out Onto the next year"

"positive","1. Analyzing the current market trends:

   - Fast charging speeds: As wireless charging technology evolves, manufacturers are striving to deliver faster charging speeds that rival wired charging. In 2025, we can expect to see wireless chargers supporting higher wattages, potentially reducing charging times for devices like the Pixel 6 and its successors.

   - Improved efficiency: Wireless charging is inherently less efficient than wired charging, with some energy lost during the transfer process. Future advancements will likely focus on improving efficiency, minimizing energy loss, and reducing heat generation.

   - New charging standards: While Qi remains the dominant wireless charging standard, new standards may emerge that offer improved performance or compatibility with specific devices.

   - Integration with furniture and surfaces: Wireless charging may become increasingly integrated into furniture, countertops, and other surfaces, providing convenient charging solutions in homes, offices, and public spaces.

2. Choosing the Right Wireless Charger (A Buyers Checklist):

   - Compatibility: Ensure the wireless charger is Qi-certified and compatible with the Pixel 6.

   - Charging Speed: Consider the maximum charging speed supported by the charger and whether it meets your needs.

   - Features: Evaluate the features offered by the charger, such as optimized charging modes, smart home integration, or portability.

   - Design: Choose a design that complements your style and fits your charging setup; consider whether you prefer a pad or a stand.

   - Price: Set a budget and compare prices across different brands and models.

   - Reviews: Read online reviews from other users to get insights into the charger's performance and reliability.

3. Exploring MagSafe Alternatives:

While the Pixel 6 does not natively support MagSafe, Apple's magnetic wireless charging technology, there are ways to achieve a similar experience using products that attach magnets to the back of the phone. However, it is essential to understand that while such solutions may exist, promising magsafe charger pixel 6 functionality, this does not mean full MagSafe compatibility or potential usage. Using these solutions with your Pixel 6 offers less potential usage compared to traditional wireless charging.

In conclusion, powering your Pixel 6 wirelessly in 2025 means taking advantage of the convenience and cable-free experience that wireless charging offers by understanding its capabilities, exploring available options, and troubleshooting common issues. As wireless charging technology continues to evolve, expect to see even more innovative and efficient charging solutions in the years to come. Whether you prioritize speed, affordability, or seamless integration, there's a wireless charger out there that's perfect for your Pixel 6. Good luck in your search!

They appreciate the Samsung S25's design, performance, and long-term software support but fear potential slowdowns, poor low-light camera performance, and battery issues compared to the iPhone 16.

"positive","The user finds the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7, despite UI concerns and sleep tracking issues, superior in terms of performance, heart rate sensor accuracy, charging speeds, and display quality compared to the Pixel Watch 2, but remains hopeful for improvements in the Pixel Watch 3.","Some thought from using the Galaxy Watch 7 after nine months of using the Pixel Watch 2.So I am hoping people take this post more as informational than anything else as I am not here to bash any device Just wanting to provide some feedback of my experienceFor some background I was already familiar with Galaxy Watches running WearOS as I had used both a Galaxy Watch 4 and 6 for just over two years before I switched to the Pixel Watch 2 last year  The only reason I even decided to try out the Galaxy Watch 7 was the insane trade in Samsung had that got me the watch for 40To start I am still not a big fan of Samsungs UI and notification handling compared to the Pixel Watch  I understand a lot of this is due to how the interface is designed around a physical rotating bezel but this watch doesnt have that and the physical crown on the Pixel Watch is much better to use than the virtual touch bezel  On the fitness side Samsung finally seems to have a heart rate sensor that works well or at least well enough for my use Prior Galaxy Watches were so bad that Samsung basically changed the way it displayed heart rate data to try and mask how many times during the day it would just randomly stop tracking  Now when I export the data out of Samsung health it shows constant tracking and while I have nothing to confirm accuracy others have reviewed it and say for regular use its as good as a wrist based heart rate tracker can be  Sleep tracking on the other hand is pretty bad  Its fine if all you want to do is track overall sleep time but sleep stage data is definitely way off  I do appreciate though that Samsung doesnt pay wall many of the bonus sleep tracking features but at the same time I have no idea how accurate they are but I guess its nice to have  I cant say much about GPS as I dont run or bike but the few times I have used Google Maps on the watch it locks my location quicklySpeaking of pay walls  Even though Samsung doesnt pay wall features into a subscription like Google does with Fitbit Premium they do lock certain features to those with Samsung phones however there are easy ways to sideload them onto the watch which is still better than having to payFor me though the biggest improvement with the Galaxy Watch 7 over any prior Galaxy Watch I have owned is the vastly improved processor and charging speeds  One of the best part of owning the Pixel Watch 2 was the lag less performance that I never had on my older Galaxy Watches and the new W1000 processor in the Galaxy Watch 7 is a revelation  It runs circles around any other watch I have owned and apps open so quickly that I find myself doing things on this watch I never did before simply due to the improved performance  Charging is also far better as my older watches generally took 152 hours to charge with no quick charging available at all  Now full charging is just under 15 hours but the watch can quick charge from 0 to 75 in around 30 to 40 minutes and I dont have to deal with pogo pins like on the Pixel Watch and worry about making sure my watch is properly aligned on the charger  Its hard to compare battery life as one watch is brand new and the other is 9 months old but battery life after the emergency battery patch on the GW7 seems better than the PW2 but not massively so  I would say 4048 hours on the GW7 with the AOD off to around 3240 hours on the Pixel Watch 2One area that hasnt changed is the vastly superior display on the Galaxy Watch over the Pixel Watch  Not only does the 40mm GW7 have a larger 131 display but its also double the brightness and covered in sapphire crystal unlike the scratch prone glass on the Pixel Watch  Thankfully we already know that the Pixel Watch 3 will match the brightness but will also come very close to matching the display size Because of the domed design I dont think Google will give us better glass but I hope they surprise us as the Gorilla Glass 5 display is easily my least favorite part about the Pixel Watch 2 which goes to show how much I love it given its my biggest source of complaintAnyway in the end I am surprised at how happy I have been with the Galaxy Watch 7  It might physically look the same as my prior Galaxy Watches but it seems to finally address almost every hardware issue I have had in the past  I have to say it makes it less certain if I will get the Pixel Watch 3 especially if the rumored lack of promos turn out to be trueIt will be interesting to see what we get with the new Pixel Watch 3 as I feel like there is still a lot of room for improvement to give it the Pixel magic we love so much from the phones  I still would love to see Assistant voice typing and Now Playing come to the watch somehow and of course I really hope Google can do something to address the scratch prone glass as I would love to be able to get away with not having to use a screen protector like I can with the Galaxy Watch In the end I imagine I will still end up with the Pixel Watch 3 but it will probably be a harder decision than I expected it to be just a few weeks ago"

In this comparison, the user is torn between Samsung S25, Google Pixel 9 Pro, and iPhone 16, prioritizing long-term software support, device compatibility, camera quality, and overall performance. The Samsung S25 offers a premium design, high-quality performance, good camera, and 7-year software support, but may lose smoothness over time. Google Pixel 9 Pro boasts the best camera, fastest updates, more RAM, and better battery life, but has less comfortable design and is behind in performance compared to S25. The iPhone 16 provides a reliable iOS experience, superior low-light camera performance, fastest updates, and the best battery life, but has an uncomfortable design and a 60Hz screen which the user finds disappointing after using higher refresh rate displays.","Samsung S25 vs Google Pixel 9 Pro vs Iphone 16.Hi guys I am in Europe RomaniaI am trying figure out to pick a mobile for myself but I am undecided to choose between phonesSince most YouTube and website reviews are untrustworthy from my side I want to ask here to get some reallife experienceI eliminated Xiaomi etc mobiles except just doubtful about OnePlus 13R Even it looks very fine in same price range it doesnt make sense for it to pay costly about overall in good and support service for me comparing with Samsung S25 Google Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 16All we know tech specs are not very point for mobiles especially comparing Android vs iPhoneHere my general observation for average daily user no gaming  Samsung S25 800  Comfortable  compact design  Premium built quality feeling  High qualitylast generation processor that can help to keep or improve its performance including battery with patches by time  Samsung OneUI 7 looks very well performed and efficiency  Good camera  Longterm 7 years major software support  Easy adaptation with devices such as earbuds pc tv etc  Almost good in all After one year afraid of losing its smoothness on UI and lacking behind Android updates getting slow  Camera is not good in low light that I am not a fan of taking photos too  Battery performance looks behind iPhone 16 but is it still worth to buy for daily user  Google Pixel 9 Pro 920  Google product and its effectiveness fastest updates on its Android software at best combability  The best camera on the list  More RAM than S25 it is 16GB  Better battery than S25 Less comfortable than S25  Much behind performance for processor than S25 that if it is such a point for daily user since the phone has stock android as soon as it gets updates and fixes  Camera is better than S25 but not noticeable for a average user maybe  People complain some buggy performance experiences where it is not told yet for S25  It looks like just a Google fan with very good camera is interested in this mobile at this costly price range  iPhone 16 870  iPhone and iOS experience dont hurt in time no afraid to get buggy or slower which is the most important for me  Good camera with better performance at lowlight than S25 which is not a case for me  As Pixel it will get all updates and fixes in fastest way not get behind  Its processor A18 beats Pixels up G4 in anyway like Samsung S25s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3  Maybe the best battery performance on the list For me very uncomfortable ugly design  60 Hz screen looks like a small joke on that after experience 120 Hz ones  Not easy going for nonApple products along to use"

"positive"," The Google Pixel 8 Pro, despite its strong hardware and exceptional camera, suffers from numerous software bugs that significantly impact usability and are not being promptly fixed.","6ish month review for Google Pixel 8 Pro.I just want to leave a usage review since Ive daily driven my Pixel 8 Pro for more than 6 months now coming from a Samsung S20 FE I switched to Pixel mainly because of the free smartwatch that it came with when preordered but I really preferred to go the Samsung route more below so I switched with a big bias But I think the review is as fair as I can be as a regular notsophonetechy userx200BPro  1 Camera Im not a big picture taker but I certainly noticed the big difference from my old phone to this  2 I do like the UI compared to Samsung and from factory the phone came with less bloatware imo compared to my S20 back then Though the only thing I would love to change with the UI is the buttons I miss how I can configure those with Samsung  3 Overall the hardware performs pretty good I dont game on my phone so I dont really feel the phone struggle with its workloads  4 The phone itself has a really nice feel and one of the biggest reason why I didnt go towards the S2324 is the size If I wanted the top phone in that model the Ultras have the pen and its essentially a Samsung tab phone from years ago I feel like 8 Pro is a decent size  5 The screen size is pretty good I can watch videos on it comfortably  6 The fact that it is made by Google means no Bixby which is like point 2 awesome because even back in Samsung I used Google assistant anyway  7 With an exception to point 2 I like how customizable it is like I said I dont do a lot of things on my phone so I am easy to please in this regardx200BCons Unfortunately this outweighs the Pros for me  1 Randomly incoming phone calls get dropped before it even reaches me I wear the watch most of the time so I should at least know if someone calls me but even then I only get notified after I missed the call no ring whatsoever Ive checked my DnD which is never on and it also happens to incoming calls from my saved contact list and other unknown numbers both from my region and outside Checked with support and my provider and both basically pointed fingers at each other only way to truly test this is to daily drive my old phone for a while I havent but Ive never experienced this at all in my old phones from the same provider on the same account  2 Dark mode on the Google search widget randomly gets disabled I have dark mode always on but sometimes when I search something on the widget when it loads its on light mode And the only way to revert this is to go on the settings and disable dark mode and reenable it Interestingly this issue started to happen recently so Im guessing from an OS upgrade  3 Again with the Google search widget randomly whenever I search something after pressing enter it says no network connection but after I click Try again it works Happens both on WiFi and cell data I have a different browser that also have a widget I want to try it but Google as a search engine is still a beast so Im debating whether I should do it or not  4 Randomly the weather widget just stops working Its still there but no weather info cant refresh it either  5 Another random issue theres times when I hit the home button from somewhere doesnt matter if it is a browser social media app YouTube or whatever the keyboard pops up But I have nothing to type on because its the homepage not sure why the software brings it up randomly  6 This is a small issue for me I hate Google Photos and the Google Gallery app is not as good as Samsungs gallery app imo There are features on Samsung that I love for example if I edit a photo on Samsung it asks if I want to save a copy or save to overwrite the original but with Pixel it just saves copy I do quick and simple edits for work so its annoying that I need to delete the original because I never need it though I understand its by design since its a good idea to have the original but at least give the option  7 Another small issue the vibrate isnt strong enough There are times when I need the phone to be nearsilent but still know when I have notifications hence vibrate but even if its in my back pocket sometimes I still miss it This is now a small issue for me because I usually wear the watch so at least my wrist would feel something when I get notifications  8 Sometimes the phone freezes for several moments I have to click the lock button or spam the home button and it miraculously works after  9 Just recently probably caused by another update when I am connected to my earbuds not Google or car through Android Auto the phone randomly goes on call but theres no call window on the phone or the car screen I know I am on call because the earbud goes on hearthrough even though it is set on ANC which typically happens when I am on call Also the car dashboard says In a call when I am even though the Android Auto screen doesnt  10 Initial setup with Android Auto when I first got the phone was a NIGHTMARE I remember my old Samsung and it was literally plug and play then configure afterwards But for this I had to do some wonky workaround I found online to get it to workEdit 11 Sometimes my home WiFi doesnt automatically connect its not a broadcasted SSID so I have to manually add it There was a time when I had to tinker with the settings to get it to work Something I never had to do with my old phoneTLDR Hardware wise the feel of the phone is good camera is exceptional for my use and its not struggling for me But SOOOO MANY bugs on the software that doesnt get fixed right away or just havent been fixedI would love to get another Pixel because Samsung is more expensive and the Ultra is too large for my taste top of the line have better freebies D but if by the time I switch phone Im still having these issues Ill definitely go back to Samsung"
